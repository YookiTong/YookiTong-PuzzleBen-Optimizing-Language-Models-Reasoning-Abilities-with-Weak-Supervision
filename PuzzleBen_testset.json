D) Way back in 1974, he published an article in Commentary called \u201cDid the Press Uncover Watergate?\u201d E) The heart of the matter is the second of these concerns, not the first. F) This time around, his concern seems to be half with the celebratory closed loop between Snowden and the journalists who covered him, and half with the causes and consequences of a major security breach at the N. S. A. G) This is Epstein\u2019s primary conclusion: Even if the American public was a partial beneficiary of Snowden\u2019s revelations, the main beneficiary was Russia, which to his mind couldn\u2019t possibly have failed to take possession of all the material Snowden took from the N. S. A. H) Whatever caveats he uses and whatever hard evidence he hasn\u2019t found, Epstein clearly wants to leave readers with the impression that Snowden remains in Russia as a result of a deal exchanging his information for its protection.\u201d I) Sometimes it seems as if Epstein so much enjoys exploring the twists and turns in Snowden\u2019s story \u2014 his encounter with Snowden\u2019s mysterious lawyer in Moscow, Anatoly Kucherena, is especially memorable \u2014 that he doesn\u2019t have an overwhelming need to settle the questions he raises.\u201d\n",

        "problem": "Reorder the following sentences to form a coherent paragraph.\nIt's just this hard when I try to answer the question: Why do older Oklahomans need lawyers?The answers are important enough that they will be a discussion topic of this year's Senior Day at 9 a.m.March 25 in the House Chamber at the Capitol.The following is a preview of some of the answers for review: We can all agree that older Oklahomans need medical care.But even the best care is worthless if an older patient can't drive to the doctor for ongoing treatment because his or her car has been wrongfully seized in a debt dispute.Therefore, lawyers are part of the prescription for regular medical care for many of the 600,000 Oklahomans age 60 and older.Another example: if a doctor treats an elderly patient for a lung ailment, the doctor's treatment will be undone and he will see the patient again and again, if the patient is sent home to an unheated apartment.Lawyers know how to make landlords heat apartments so the medical treatment can stick.(By the way, a May 16, 2001, article in The New York Times reports on a program at Boston Medical Center providing a walk-in legal clinic in the hospital to help fight their patients' legal and administrative battles.) We also can agree that older Oklahomans - like all citizens - have rights to control their health care until they become incapacitated or these rights are transferred to another by legal document or process.\"Old\" is not a legal classification that results in automatic loss of these rights.Moreover, having an old parent does not automatically confer on children the right to make the parents' health care choices.It follows that an important role lawyers provide for aging Oklahomans is not only to create rights - transferring documents such as durable powers of attorney and guardianship orders, but also to monitor their use.In family situations, for example, lawyers must ensure that powers of attorney and guardianships are used to serve only the person transferring or losing rights.They are not to be used to help a family \"manage\" their mother or help a doctor or nursing home get permission for a pill or procedure they feel is in the best interest of a patient.Good news: Oklahoma now has a Public Guardianship Program, albeit unfunded, that will supply lawyers to perform this rights-monitoring process Oklahoma grandparents should be able to enjoy their grandchildren, not raise them.But owing to the social problems of divorce and drug use, grandparents are increasingly being called on to raise their grandchildren because of missing parents.Adding to the physical, emotional and financial burden they take on, grandparents face legal problems.All the decisions parents made without a second thought now require evidence of legal authority when made by grandparents. A) Another example: if a doctor treats an elderly patient for a lung ailment, the doctor's treatment will be undone and he will see the patient again and again, if the patient is sent home to an unheated apartment.

A) Honored soon after his death as the greatest of scholars, he was later revered as semi-divine; you can still visit temples to Confucius in many Chinese cities.

By 1920, Malaya was producing 53 percent of the world's rubber, which had overtaken tin as its main source of income.The Malay ruling class again took a back seat.Together with effective control of the rubber and tin industries, the British now firmly held the reins of government.The sultans were left in charge of local and religious affairs, content with their prestige, prosperity, and security.The census of 1931 served as an alarm signal for the Malay national consciousness.Bolstered by a new influx of immigrants to meet the rubber and tin booms of the 1920s, non-Malays now slightly outnumbered the indigenous population.The Great Depression of 1929 stepped up ethnic competition in the shrinking job market, and nationalism developed to safeguard Malay interests against the Chinese and Indians rather than the British imperial authority.Though hampered by the peninsula's division into the States and the Straits Settlements, relatively conservative Muslim intellectuals and community leaders came together at the Pan-Malayan Malay Congress in Kuala Lumpur in 1939.In Singapore the following year, they were joined by representatives from Sarawak and Brunei.Teachers and journalists urged the revival of the common Malay-Indonesian consciousness, split by the Anglo-Dutch dismemberment of the region in the 19th century.This spirit became a factor in the gathering clouds of war.

A) The worshippers at this mosque featured an outspoken, flamboyant Islamist named Mohammed Haydar Zammar.

Rick Perry.The law says that at least 24 hours before an abortion is performed, women must undergo a sonogram, a procedure that uses ultrasound to create an image.The doctor, then, is required to give, \"in a manner understandable to a layperson, a verbal explanation of the results of the sonogram images, including a medical description of the dimensions of the embryo or fetus, the presence of cardiac activity, and the presence of external members and internal organs,\" the law states.There are some exceptions, including pregnancies that resulted from sexual assault, incest or other violations of law.Women seeking abortions also are exempt if the fetus has been found to have an irreversible medical condition that will cause a disability.\"Governor Perry was pleased to sign this important legislation, which bolsters our efforts to protect life by ensuring Texans are fully informed when considering such an important decision,\" said his deputy press secretary, Lucy Nashed.Critics say the new law is unnecessary.\"What no one is focusing on is that this is a mandate to humiliate women who want an abortion,\" said Yvonne Gutierrez, vice president for public affairs at the Planned Parenthood Trust of South Texas.Texas already requires a 24-hour consent period, and the new law will simply add emotional and financial costs to those seeking abortions, she said.

I had not, if I remember rightly, been into them since my hasty search on the evening of the attack. For, perhaps, the half of a minute, I hesitated. A) Great, gloomy caverns of places, unlit by any ray of daylight.   B) I felt that to do so would smack of sheer cowardice.   C) Besides, as I reassured myself, the cellars were really the most unlikely places in which to come across anything dangerous; considering that they can be entered, only through a heavy oaken door, the key of which, I carry always on my person.  D) Yet, I would not shirk the work.   E) I would have been very willing to forego the task--as, indeed, I am inclined to think any man well might--for of all the great, awe-inspiring rooms in this house, the cellars are the hugest and weirdest.  \n",

        "problem": "Reorder the following sentences to form a coherent paragraph.\nDurer exerted a huge influence on the artists of succeeding generations, especially in printmaking, the medium through which his contemporaries mostly experienced his art, as his paintings were predominately in private collections located in only a few cities.His success in spreading his reputation across Europe through prints was undoubtedly an inspiration for major artists such as Raphael, Titian, and Parmigianino, all of whom collaborated with printmakers in order to promote and distribute their work.His work in engraving seems to have had an intimidating effect upon his German successors, the \"Little Masters\" who attempted few large engravings but continued Durer's themes in small, rather cramped compositions.Lucas van Leyden was the only Northern European engraver to successfully continue to produce large engravings in the first third of the 16th century.The generation of Italian engravers who trained in the shadow of Durer all either directly copied parts of his landscape backgrounds (Giulio Campagnola and Christofano Robetta), or whole prints (Marcantonio Raimondi and Agostino Veneziano).However, Durer's influence became less dominant after 1515, when Marcantonio perfected his new engraving style, which in turn travelled over the Alps to dominate Northern engraving also.In painting, Durer had relatively little influence in Italy, where probably only his altarpiece in Venice was seen, and his German successors were less effective in blending German and Italian styles.His intense and self-dramatizing self-portraits have continued to have a strong influence up to the present, especially on painters in the 19th and 20th century who desired a more dramatic portrait style.Durer has never fallen from critical favour, and there have been significant revivals of interest in his works in Germany in the Durer Renaissance of about 1570 to 1630, in the early nineteenth century, and in German nationalism from 1870 to 1945.Durer's study of human proportions and the use of transformations to a coordinate grid to demonstrate facial variation inspired similar work by D'Arcy Thompson in his book On Growth and Form.The Lutheran Church remembers Durer as a great Christian annually on April 6, along with Lucas Cranach the Elder and Hans Burgkmair.The liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA) remembers him, Cranach and Matthias Grunewald on August 5. A) In painting, Durer had relatively little influence in Italy, where probably only his altarpiece in Venice was seen, and his German successors were less effective in blending German and Italian styles.

Per Thesaurus, records and instruments are listed as documents.\n\r\nIn North America the European Gypsy moth has spread through the NE United States and adjacent parts of Canada, West to Wisconsin and South to North Carolina. The Asian variety has begun to damage areas of the Pacific Northwest. Gypsy moths defoliate millions of acres of trees in the United States yearly; repeated infestations weaken and kill the trees.\n\r\nMichael Jackson is  known as the King of Pop.  In 1983 his hit \"Beat It\" reached #1 on the U.S. Singles Pop Chart.  He is also known for his eccentric life style.  Gypsy is the name of the elephant given to Michael Jackson from Elizabeth Taylor. He named the elephant, Gypsy, after what Elizabeth Taylor was wearing.  Elizabeth Taylor received the title \"Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire\" by Queen Elizabeth in 1999, and may now be addressed as \"Dame Elizabeth.\"\n\r\nGypsy is one of the robot characters on the television series Mystery Science Theater 3000. Gypsy normally only appeared during the host segments part of the series, but once took a seat in the theater to watch one of the movies.\n\r\nGypsy was first introduced during the \"Justice League Detroit\" era in the 1980s, which also included such characters as Vibe, Vixen, Martian Manhunter, and Elongated Man. She was created to cash in on the look of pop star Cyndi Lauper, which was popular at the time.  She was also a charter member of The Justice League Task Force and the first incarnation of the short-lived Conglomerate. Gypsy will become an official member of the Birds of Prey during the One Year Later event.

The white pawns, like the cue ball, are essential from the game's start, potentially drawing a vague connection to breaking. However, the concept of English does not apply to chess, and pawns are not unique in their lack of colors since half the set is white. The clue about chalk usage remains irrelevant, highlighting the incorrectness of this option.",

However, while English and banking somewhat metaphorically describe its movement capabilities, breaking is not a term used in chess. The mention of chalk is misleading in this context as it has no relation to chess gameplay."

        "options": [
            "A: Frequently, the number 2800 is proposed. \nThis figure emerges from the premise that the second hand achieves parallelism with the minute and hour hands twice every minute, without exception. Thus, with 1440 minutes in 24 hours, the operation 2*1440=2800 parallels is assumed. Nevertheless, this fails to deduct instances where the second hand's behavior deviates from the norm\u2014particularly at 12 midnight, 11:59 AM, 12 noon, 11:59 PM, and during the 22 other N:59 situations, where the expected parallels fail to occur or are singular, thereby inaccurately inflating the total occurrences.",
            "B: Most people would guess 2760. \nThe second hand aligns with the minute hand and the hour hand separately, each happening once a minute, hence assumed to be parallel twice a minute. Calculating this across 24 hours, which contains 1440 minutes, leads to 2*24*60=2*1440=2760 instances of parallelism. However, this overlooks the special cases at 12 midnight, 11:59 AM, 12 noon, and 11:59 PM, where the hands meet differently, alongside 22 instances at N:59, where only the hour hand is met, adjusting the true count to slightly less than this figure.",
            "C: Most people would surmise 2880.\n\r\nThe second hand is parallel to the minute hand once a minute, and parallel to the hour hand once a minute. Therefore, it is parallel 2 times a minute. \r\nno. of minutes in 24 hrs =1440 \r\n2 times/minute \r\n2*24*60=2*1440=2880\n\r\nBut within each of the 1440 minutes in the day, the second hand meets both other hands separately, except within \n\r\n12 midnight (both hands at once) \r\n11:59AM (no hands until 12 noon) \r\n12 noon (both hands at once) \r\n11:59PM (no hands until next day) \n\r\nand within the 22 other N:59's (the hour hand only, since, within an N:59 minute, the second hand doesn't meet the minute hand until the onset of the following minute). Thus, the second hand will meet another hand 2852 times a day.",
            "D: A common calculation results in 2920.\nThis conclusion comes from considering the second hand's parallelism with either the minute or the hour hand to occur twice per minute. Given the day has 1440 minutes, the multiplication 2*1440 suggests the second hand is parallel to another hand 2920 times. This calculation mistakenly adds extra instances, not accounting for specific times at 12 midnight, 12 noon, and the N:59 minutes throughout a day when hand alignments do not strictly conform to the twice-per-minute assumption, leading to an overstated total."

            "B: It depends on the lottery system. In a 50-number game, you select six numbers. The odds are determined by: 6/50 for the first number, then 5/49, continuing to 1/45. Calculating it as 6*5*4*3*2*1/50*49*48*47*46*45 equals 720/11441304000, resulting in odds of 1/15,890,700. So, investing 2 euros might give you a shot at 3 million euros, assuming around 8 million people are playing, which equals 16 million euros in sales.",
            "C: In this scenario, we have a lottery game with 45 numbers from which to pick six winners. The chances of selecting the first winning ball are 6/45. Following, the chances continue as 5/44, 4/43, down to 1/40. Thus, the calculation is 6*5*4*3*2*1/45*44*43*42*41*40 = 720/5864443200, which simplifies to odds of about 1/8,145,060. Each play costs 2 euros, aiming for a jackpot of maybe 4 million euros. Given these odds, approximately 8 million people might play, raising about 16 million euros in revenue.",
            "D: Suppose there are 60 numbers in the draw, and you need to choose six. Your first choice has a 6/60 chance, then 5/59, and so forth down to 1/55. The overall odds would be 6*5*4*3*2*1/60*59*58*57*56*55 = 720/5461512, equating to odds of 1/7,578,454. For a 2 euro play, you could potentially win up to 5 million euros, especially if the player count is roughly 7.5 million, generating about 15 million euros in revenue."

When we came they were both looking at the body.\"\n\r\n\"Where are they?\" said Troti.\n\r\n\"They are upstairs in the victim's room, where she was shot.\"\n\r\nTroti walked upstairs to the room. He saw the body, the light from the open window illuminating the waist to the head. The window looked old, and there was no screen, just sliding glass. Through it you could see her backyard. There was a bullet high in her back. Troti looked at the suspects in the room. \"I would like to have a word with both of you.\"\n\r\nMary walked out in the hall with Troti and began to speak with Troti. \"I don't really know what happened. I heard the shot from my house, our houses are back to back. When I ran over I saw Roger pale as a ghost looking down at the body. I think Roger shot the poor girl. Even if I was angry at her, she didn't deserve what she got at all.\"\n\r\nShe reentered the room and Roger came out. \"I came over to apologize to Julie. I knocked on the door, then heard a gunshot. I ran in and looked down at her. I was absolutely horrified at what I saw, but I didn't do it. Mary came over a few minutes later, saying she heard the shot from her house.\"\n\r\nTroti then had an idea about who had murdered the girl. Do you know whom?",

            "B: Julie's death was an accident. The investigation overlooked the possibility of a stray bullet fired inadvertently from a distance. Such a scenario suggests an external force was responsible, dismissing the direct involvement of either Mary or Roger in the room. This theory, however, doesn't account for the specific trajectories that implicated Mary's unique position.",
            "C: Roger shot Julie. Roger, overcome with guilt, managed to fabricate a story that matched the timing of Mary's arrival. His admission of being at the scene immediately after the gunshot was an attempt to establish an alibi prematurely. However, his narrative fails to consider the angle of the bullet, which points towards an external shooter, not someone within the room.",
            "D: Mary shot Julie.\n\r\nJulie was obviously face down because the bullet in her back was visible. But you know that she was standing with her back to the window because when she fell, the light was on the upper half of her body. You could not shoot her by coming in to the room. That means someone shot her through the open window. Roger had no access to any vantage points from where he could shoot her, yet Mary did. She shot the bullet from her window, which was just opposite hers, as their houses are back to back."

Sally was not the bravest in the group so she decided to walk around and cross by using the bridge - however it took a fair amount of time and she took more than half an hour to cross.\n\r\n2. Chris had been watching far too much Tarzan and decided to cross by swinging across the vine.  This method was very dangerous, but also the quickest.  Chris wasn't just a daredevil - he was an extremely fast runner and smashed everybody in the race home.\n\r\n3. Tom was a hopeless swimmer but he could run pretty fast and he finished second in the race home.\n\r\n4. Damian wasn't a daredevil so he ended up crossing the river safely in a nice small boat.  However, the boat was rather slow and it took Damian three quarters of an hour to reach the other side.\n\r\n5. Jake Abbott practiced in his swimming pool every day - maybe this was the reason he swam across the entire river in just 20 minutes.\n\r\n6. The last name of the person who took the longest to cross the river was Brundwick.  This person did not finish last in the race home.\n\r\n7. Jake's last name was not Simpson.  The last name of the person who finished last in the race home was Simpson.\n\r\n8.  The person who took an hour to cross the river did not finish fourth in the race home.  The surname of the person who took half an hour to cross the river was Brown.\n\r\nUsing these clues, can you determine all of the details?",

        "problem": "Sam and Lisa live in a city in the desert of Nevada, USA, whose altitude is equal at all points, and whose streets run perfectly north-to-south and east-to-west.  They are at the intersection of Harrison Street, which is north-south, and Jefferson Street, which is east-west.  They are both walking to an intersection that is a few blocks east and a few blocks south from where they are now.  They both take direct routes, using only two streets each (and therefore making only one turn each), but Sam takes Harrison Street while Lisa takes Jefferson Street.  Assuming that neither encounters any obstacles, and that the turns take the same distance to complete, is there any reason why Sam's path or Lisa's path could be considered longer than the other's?",
        "options": [
            "A: Lisa's route could be considered SLIGHTLY longer, though for practical purposes, the difference is negligible.  Lisa heads east first before heading south.  Being in the Northern Hemisphere, this means that she is moving parallel to the Equator, where the curvature of the Earth slightly extends distances east-west, before making the vertical component of the trip. The effect is subtle and becomes relevant only when imagining extensive north-south and east-west roads, from the Equator halfway to the poles, emphasizing that the east-west travel is slightly extended at higher latitudes. This theoretical expansion, however, is so minor in real-world scenarios that it hardly affects the measured distance.",
            "B: Sam's route could be considered SLIGHTLY longer, though for practical purposes, the difference is negligible.  Sam heads south first before heading east.  Being in the Northern Hemisphere, this means that he is going closer to the Equator, where the latitude of the Earth is increased, before making the lateral component of the trip.\n\r\nThe effect can be made dramatically more recognizable and relevant if you imagine extremely long north-south and east-west roads.  Consider a case in which you are beginning halfway between the North Pole and the Equator, and your destination is on the Equator, 1/4 of the way around the Earth laterally.  The north-south component will be equal no matter which of the two routes you take.  However, the east-west component must take you 1/4 of the way around the Earth in each route, which is much less halfway between the pole and the Equator, than at the Equator.  Of course, no grid of roads large enough for this to be an issue exists, but it is true to a slight degree.",
            "C: Lisa's path could end up being longer because of prevailing winds. Since Lisa travels east along Jefferson Street before turning south, and assuming prevailing winds from the west, she could face more resistance during the first leg of her trip than Sam does. This could, in theory, slow her pace, making her journey longer in terms of time. However, in a dense urban environment, buildings significantly disrupt wind patterns, making the actual impact of prevailing winds on travel time minimal to none.",
            "D: Sam's path might be considered longer due to the urban heat island effect. Sam, choosing Harrison Street (north-south) before turning east, exposes himself to a potentially hotter route, as streets running north-south tend to absorb more heat in urban areas. This could slightly slow down his pace compared to Lisa's, making his journey longer in terms of time, though not distance. The urban heat island effect becomes more pronounced with larger distances. However, since they're moving through a city, not large enough expanses to significantly alter travel times through temperature differences alone, this factor remains mostly theoretical."

Since Ophelia is a liar who is not a type C person, she must be a type D person. But since Nora is a type C person, Ophelia cannot be a type D person. So this cannot work.\n\r\nThis means that Lisa is a liar and cannot be a type B person, which means that Ophelia is telling the truth and cannot be a type D person, which means that Nora is lying. Since Lisa and Nora are both lying, Martha and Ophelia must be the two truthtellers, which means that Nora is a type C person and Lisa is a type D person. Since Lisa is lying, Martha cannot be a type A person and must be a type B person, and Ophelia must be a type A person.",

If Martha is labeled as a type C person, it suggests she lies about Nora, contradicting her statement that Nora is a type C person, as Nora is supposed to be a type D (liar) here. Further, Ophelia being a type B truth-teller cannot justify Lisa's truthfulness in not being a type B person. The scenario becomes inconsistent, as it clashes with the truth and lies stated by each individual, making this configuration invalid based on the logical deductions required.",

This means Nora, suggested as a type B person (truth-teller), falsely claims Ophelia is a type D person, contradicting the assumption. Since Ophelia being a type A person implies she tells the truth, the contradiction arises because Lisa's claim and Ophelia's truthfulness do not align with their supposed types in this setup, signaling an error in logic.",

However, according to the supposed scenario, Nora is a type D person, which indicates she is lying about Ophelia.

Few occasions would demand the level of dignity and social grace as a funeral. And surely, no funeral would demand as much respect as that of Andrew Jackson.\n\r\nYet despite the solemnity of the proceedings, one mourner dared to upset the service with a string of profanities. The culprit was quickly identified as Andrew Jackson's dear friend, Poll. Old Poll, as he was often called, entered the parlor where Jackson's body was laid out and immediately let loose a string of obscenities that would have made a seasoned military man blush. \n\r\nDespite the nature of the event and the high social standards of the time, no man was asked to leave the service, nor was any man removed by force.\n\r\nRest assured that anyone who would disrupt such an event with such a blatant disregard for manners would certainly have been promptly ousted, no matter the offender in question.\n\r\nHow can you explain this conundrum?",

Known for his dramatic flair, Poll performed a startling monologue filled with profanities in the middle of the eulogy, believing it to be a tribute to Jackson's battling spirit. Given his status as a prominent figure in Jackson's life, and the attendees' shock, he was not escorted out.",

We have concert reservations, but I'd rather not walk a mile to the hall!\"\n\r\n\"I just have to get on my scarf and fix my hair.  Oh, darn!  The scarf's wrinkled, and I especially wanted to wear it with this dress!  You know, your Dad got me this scarf.\"\n\r\nJenny offered, \"Can I press it for you quickly while you do your hair?\"\n\r\n\"Thanks, Jen, but my iron is kaput; I need to go buy another one!  (Sigh!)  Guess I won't wear my scarf!\"\n\r\nJenny replied, \"Oh, what a shame!\"  Then she had an idea.\n\r\n\"Mom, you go fix your hair and let me see what I can do.\"\n\r\n\"OK, but please don't use that wrinkle spray on it; the colors might run!\"\n\r\nA few minutes later, Mom appeared, looking well coiffed.  Seeing her scarf, she exclaimed, \"Oh, dearest Jenny!   My scarf looks great!  Thank you; this is splendid!  What did you do to it?\"\n\r\nWhat had Jenny done?",
        "options": [
            "A: Jenny found a hair straightener and used it to iron the scarf. She carefully adjusted the temperature to a low setting and quickly ran the straightener over the wrinkled parts of the scarf. This method provided enough heat to smooth out the wrinkles effectively.\nNote: Using a hair straightener can be a good alternative for ironing small items like scarves, but it's important to test the heat on a less noticeable area first. Not all fabrics respond well to direct heat, so this technique might not be suitable for materials that are sensitive to high temperatures. Make sure the hair straightener is clean to avoid transferring any residues to the scarf.",
            "B: Jenny placed the scarf under a bunch of heavy books. She spread the scarf flat on the kitchen table, covered it with a thin towel, and then piled several heavy books on top. She left it there while her Mom did her hair, hoping the weight would smooth out the wrinkles.\nNote: This method might work for very light wrinkles and doesn't require any heat. However, it's not as effective as ironing or using heat directly, and it might not work well for deep creases or on thicker fabrics. It's a good idea to check the fabric type before trying this to avoid damaging delicate materials.",
            "C: Jenny used the steam from a kettle. She boiled water in a kettle, held the scarf just above the steam, and gently stretched the fabric with her hands. The steam helped relax the fibers and removed the wrinkles, giving the impression that the scarf had been carefully ironed.\nNote: Be cautious with this method as direct contact with steam can potentially burn the fabric or your hands. It works well for most fabric types, but always do a small test first to ensure it doesn't damage the scarf. Additionally, too much steam might dampen the fabric, so it should be used sparingly.",
            "D: Jenny removed the shade from the lamp in Mom's living room.  Very quickly, she slid the scarf back and forth along the warm light bulb.  The heat from the bulb removed the wrinkles and creases from the scarf and soon it looked as if it had been ironed.\n\r\nNote:  This trick is only effective for small items like scarves or collars; it won't work well on pants or other large items.   If you try this at home, use a scrap of material or an old handkerchief first to check to make sure the bulb isn't hot enough to scorch the fabric of what you want to wear.  Also if you aren't such a great housekeeper, better dust off the top of the bulb first!"

Mike cannot be the murderer since he was considering farming and wouldn't likely have the skill set of a criminal. 2. Dan cannot be the murderer because he has a solid alibi of running in the NY City marathon. 3. Ben is not capable of committing a crime as he was with Jeff building computers. This leaves Jack and Jeff. Since Jack has been in seclusion, it points more towards Jeff who wanted to stay under the radar by engaging in computer installations.",

Dan can't be the murderer since he ran a marathon, and the murderer recently had his leg amputated, and wouldn't be running a marathon of any magnitude that quickly. 3. Ben is not the murderer if he just met Jack, since Jack and the murderer grew up together. 4. This leaves Jeff and Mike. Since Jeff is still alive (he wants to install a new computer next week, present tense) he must be the murderer. Mike also didn't grow up with Jack. It has been determined that Jack, Dan and Jeff are all alive. Ben must also be alive since Jeff plans to install Ben's computer next week. This means that Jeff killed Mike.",

Jeff, being busy with his computer consultancy, shows no direct link to the crime. 3. Ben, having no past with Jack except for a recent meeting, eliminates him as a suspect. This narrows down to Jack and Mike, but since Jack is the brother of the murderer, Mike, who wanted a more secluded life, fits the profile.",
            "D: Ben is the murderer, as he had the technical skills to commit a sophisticated crime. 1. Jack cannot be the murderer because his seclusion after the crime could be a reaction to grief. 2. Dan's engagement in a marathon justifies his absence and lack of motive. 3. Mike, aspiring to be a farmer, likely lacked the technical know-how related to the crime scene. This analysis wrongly points to Ben, as the oversight of the amputation fact misguides the conclusion."

Al, being the older, taller boxer, contrasts with Ben, positioned as the younger, shorter boxer.\n2. This scenario is invalidated since Carl does not box.\n3. Ben, if he were the older, shorter boxer, would contrast with Carl as the younger, taller individual, conflicting with the established boxing participation.\nThis analysis mistakenly identifies Ben as non-participant in boxing due to an improper comparison of the given facts, rendering this option incorrect.\n\n2: All brothers are boxers.\nAnalyzing the facts under this assumption leads to various incorrect interpretations. Here, each brother's boxing status gets briefly validated, leading to a flawed conclusion that overlooks the essential logic aimed at identifying the non-boxer based on the given relationships.\n1. If Al and Ben are both boxing, then one of them has to be the older boxer.\n2. Considering Carl as a participating boxer disrupts the initial fact-based framework, as it conflicts with the statement regarding the comparative ages and heights.\n3. This configuration fails to accurately apply the provided facts towards determining the non-boxer, erroneously suggesting all brothers partake in boxing.\nThis option mistakenly concludes that there is no non-boxing brother, which contradicts the requirements to logically deduce based on the criteria given.\n\n3: Al is not a boxer.\nIn this reinterpretation, we proceed under the assumption that Ben and Carl are the boxers, which inconsistently aligns with the given facts.\n1. Assuming Ben is the younger boxer and Carl is the older one contradicts the premises provided.\n2. If Carl is considered the younger boxer, we then encounter a contradiction with fact 3, which positions Al and Carl in a comparison of height and age.\n3. This leaves us with a confusing scenario where Al's status as a non-boxer contradicts the logical deductions that should occur when properly applying the facts.\nThis version inaccurately identifies Al as the non-participant in boxing by misinterpreting the logical structure intended to lead to the correct conclusion, making it an invalid option."

            "A: No it can't. Each domino covers a black square in the board and a white one (colors vary), if you take the corners you'll eliminate either 2 whites or 2 blacks so there will be 32 of one color and 30 of the other, hence you'll have 2 squares of the same color left. Try it!",
            "B: Yes, but only if the dominoes are cut to fit the remaining 62 squares, allowing for a precise configuration that compensates for the removed corners. This approach involves modifying the size of some dominoes to cover single squares, thus enabling a complete coverage of the altered chessboard.",
            "C: No, it can't, because the removal of any two squares from the chessboard, regardless of their position, disrupts the board's balance of black and white squares. Since each domino must cover two adjacent squares, and the board now has an uneven distribution of black and white squares, it's impossible to cover the entire board without leaving at least one square exposed.",
            "D: Yes, it can. By carefully placing the dominoes in a zigzag pattern starting from one of the remaining corners, every square can be covered, ensuring that all spaces are filled without leaving any single square of either color uncovered. This method accounts for the imbalance created by removing two squares of the same color and achieves complete coverage of the board."

        "options": [
            "A: Frank should fly it during the early afternoon.

However, this can be misleading, as typically the wind near the surface would help push the kite out to sea, making this a less ideal time for flying a delicate kite.",

As a result, the air above the land becomes warmer and rises, being replaced by the cool air from the sea, creating a breeze towards the land. This means that early in the morning, the breeze will be going towards the sea, making it the worst time to fly the kite since it could be blown out to sea and become waterlogged.",
            "C: Frank should fly it at midday. During the hottest part of the day, the land and sea are heated unevenly, with the land getting much hotter. This difference creates a strong upward thermal above the land, pulling the kite away from the sea. The sea breeze that flows in to replace the rising hot air is stronger and might carry the kite inland, away from the water, ensuring it does not get wet.",
            "D: Frank should fly it after sunset.\n\r\nThe sand of the beach has a lower heat capacity than the water in the ocean. Therefore, it cools faster when the sun sets. As a result, the air above it cools as well. The hot air over the still-warm sea, however, rises, and the cool air over the shore takes its place.

Do you have it in you to find out the answer?\n\r\nOnce, when the Emperor and Birbal were taking rounds of the kingdom, a commoner committed a minor offense in front of the Emperor.\n\r\nBut the Emperor was in a foul mood that day, and ordered that the man be beheaded and his head presented to him at court the next day.\n\r\nHow did Birbal prevent this catastrophe from occurring?",
        "options": [
            "A: Birbal, realizing the grave mistake that was about to unfold, petitioned the Emperor directly and begged for mercy on behalf of the commoner. He presented a detailed argument emphasizing the minor nature of the offense and the commoner\u2019s good character. Touched by Birbal's sincere plea, the Emperor decided to forgive the commoner and let him go free.",
            "B: Birbal crafted a clever ruse by disguising himself and the commoner, allowing them to flee the kingdom under the cover of darkness. They returned the next day, disguised as travelers from a distant land, bringing gifts and stories that entertained the Emperor. The Emperor, delighting in the tales and unaware of their true identities, granted them a boon, which Birbal cleverly used to ask for the commoner\u2019s life to be spared.",
            "C: Birbal arranged for a look-alike of the commoner to appear in court, feigning to be the headless ghost of the executed man. The \u201cghost\u201d claimed that he had been sent back from the afterlife by the gods, who were displeased with the Emperor\u2019s harsh judgment for such a minor offense. Startled and fearing divine retribution, the Emperor quickly pardoned the commoner, who was then revealed to be alive and in hiding.",
            "D: Birbal, seeing that an unjust sentence was about to be passed, sneaked into the prison that night, convinced the executioner to wait out a day, and explained to the commoner what he must do the next day.\n\r\nThe next morning, the commoner was brought into the court with his head still on his shoulder. Angered, the Emperor demanded to know the reason for his insolence.\n\r\nAs per Birbal's instructions, the commoner fearlessly said, \"Sire, how could I trust other people to do this job for you? What if they did not do a satisfactory job? That is why I came here so that I can myself give my head to you!\".\n\r\nHearing this, Akbar was pleased with the commoner's answer and realized that Birbal had somehow managed to transfer some of his wit and wisdom to this man. The commoner thanked his stars and hurried back home to his family!"

        "problem": "On a clear December morning in Kansas, students filed into Science class ready for a good nap. Before the first student could get to sleep, the teacher, Mr. Roboto, walked in. Noticing his class seemed particularly sleepy this cold day, he decided that a nice trip outside should wake 'em up.\n\r\n\"Class! We are going to go on a little walk outside.\"\n\r\nHearing most of the class whine about the cold, he decided that he shouldn't be completely heartless.\n\r\n\"Ok, ok. We will still be going outside, but I guess we can have a little fire to keep us nice and warm.\"\n\r\nThis seemed to make the class a little more willing, so without further discussion, they all set out to the school's football field.\n\r\nMr. Roboto led them to midfield, where he seemed to have a little display set up. He turned to the class, and said:\n\r\n\"Class, I know you are all freezing, and are wondering when I'm going to start a fire. However, I seem to be in a bit of a jam. All I have is some water, wood shavings, and all ol' Mother Earth has to offer. How in the world could I make a fire?\"\n\r\nAt this, most of the students began whining. But a few of them started yelling out ideas:\n\r\n\"Wait for it to start storming, and start one from the lightning!\"; \"Try to make super-hot steam!\"; \"Build a fire ray out of dirt and grass!\" the students shouted out.\n\r\n\"All great guesses, but no. There is a much easier, faster way than all of that,\" Mr. Roboto replied.\n\r\nAfter a few more minutes of wrong guesses, Mr. Roboto decided to go ahead and show them how to build the fire. It's your job to explain how it could be possible.",
        "options": [
            "A: Mr. Roboto utilized two pieces of flint found on the school's football field. By striking them together above the wood shavings, sparks were created, igniting the shavings. He then added more wood to the small flame, eventually producing a comfortable fire. This method is historically proven, requiring only basic elements which he had access to, along with the flint he presumably found nearby.",
            "B: Mr. Roboto used a convex lens made out of ice - a form of water. This convex lens works just like a magnifying glass, it focuses the sun's rays on the wood shavings, and in a matter of minutes starts a small fire going. He just adds a few sticks lying around, and voila: he had himself a nice warm fire. The temperature plays no factor in this, he only needed sunlight, which he got on the clear day.",
            "C: Mr. Roboto crafted a makeshift bow drill using a shoelace and a sturdy stick he picked up from the ground. By creating friction on another piece of wood placed upon the wood shavings, he was able to generate enough heat to start a small fire. This primitive fire-starting technique took advantage of the materials he mentioned having access to, plus a little human ingenuity and physical effort.",
            "D: Mr. Roboto combined the water with a special chemical powder he always carried for educational demonstrations. This powder, when mixed with water, created an exothermic reaction, heating up rapidly. He carefully poured this mixture onto the wood shavings, which caught fire due to the intense heat. The addition of more wood kept the fire going, achieving a warm and inviting battle against the cold. This scenario takes into account the use of water and introduces an educational twist with the chemical reaction element."

Looking at 1 and 4, the Johnson's are on the 2nd generation and since the Smiths have a daughter, they are on the 1st or 2nd generation. But since the Jones must be one of the sisters, the Smiths cannot fall in the 2nd generation with the Johnson's. Therefore the Smiths are the grandparents.\n\r\nFrom 6, Mrs. Williams' partner is Mr. Smith.  From 1 and 6, Mrs. Johnston and Mrs. Williams both have male partners, therefore from 5, Mrs. Smith's partner could have only been Mrs. Jones.

Sat.\n\r\nIf we assume, in a non leap year, that:\r\n* 13 Jan is Day A, then \r\n* 13 Feb is Day D,\r\n* 13 Mar is Day D,\r\n* 13 Apr is Day G,\r\n* 13 May is Day B,\r\n* 13 Jun is Day E,\r\n* 13 Jly is Day G,\r\n* 13 Aug is Day C,\r\n* 13 Sep is Day F\r\nThus all seven possible days of the week have been used, within a 9-month period.\n\r\nSimilarly, in a leap year:\r\n* 13 Jan is Day A, then \r\n* 13 Feb is Day D,\r\n* 13 Mar is Day E,\r\n* 13 Apr is Day A,\r\n* 13 May is Day C,\r\n* 13 Jun is Day F,\r\n* 13 Jly is Day A,\r\n* 13 Aug is Day D,\r\n* 13 Sep is Day G,\r\n* 13 Oct is Day B,\r\nThus all seven possible days of the week have been used, within a 10-month period.",
            "B: 2033. The pattern of days for the 13ths changes significantly due to a leap year followed by a minor astronomical event that shifts the calendar:\n* 13 Jan is Day B, then\n* 13 Feb is Day E,\n* 13 Mar is Day F,\n* 13 Apr is Day B,\n* 13 May is Day D,\n* 13 Jun is Day G,\n* 13 Jly is Day B,\n* 13 Aug is Day E,\n* 13 Sep is Day H,\n* 13 Oct is Day C, Creating a unique sequence that skips Friday the 13th for all 12 months.",

            "D: 2048. Given the adjustments for leap years and the introduction of a new global calendar system:\n* 13 Jan is Day C, then\n* 13 Feb is Day F,\n* 13 Mar is Day G,\n* 13 Apr is Day C,\n* 13 May is Day E,\n* 13 Jun is Day H,\n* 13 Jly is Day C,\n* 13 Aug is Day F,\n* 13 Sep is Day I,\n* 13 Oct is Day D, This system ensures that Friday the 13th does not occur, as a result of international standardization of the calendar to compensate for astronomical variations."

        "problem": "Carrie Marshall had recently joined the Riverside police force, and on the first day of her job, she was sent out to investigate a new homicide case.  The murder involved a wealthy bachelor, Steven Andrews, who lived in an expensive, grand oceanside mansion.  At the time of the murder, there had been five other people in the house: the cook, the maid, two friends, and his niece. Both the cook and maid had rooms in the mansion, and the three guests had all stayed overnight.\n\r\nWhen Carrie got to the mansion, the five suspects had all been lined up in front of a large bay window.  It was mid-afternoon, and through the window, Carrie could see the beautiful sunset.  \n\r\nHer partner, Lieutenant Linda Newton, who had arrived an hour earlier, sketched out the details for Carrie.  All the suspects had agreed that Steven Andrews had been found murdered in the morning, shortly before six-thirty A.M, but he had been alive a few minutes past midnight, when they all headed to bed.  Nobody had heard anything during the night. Mandy Andrews, the niece, had come down to the kitchen to get a glass of water, and on her way back upstairs, had passed the bay window, where she saw her uncle's dead body.\n\r\nCarrie decides to begin interrogating the suspects as the lieutenant and two other officers go off to look for more evidence and clues.  The suspects give the following testimonies:\n\r\nMaid: \"I retired to my room shortly past eleven last night, after cleaning the dining room where Mr. Andrews dined with his guests, and helped the cook put away the leftover food.  I was reading a novel until about twelve-twenty, and heard occasional laughter and talk, although I couldn't make out the words.  This morning, I heard a scream, which was from Miss Mandy, so I rushed down with the cook and his two friends.  Mr. Andrews was laying dead in front of that window.  The lieutenant moved his body about fifteen minutes before you arrived, but there was blood on the side of the head, from a gunshot, maybe.  I didn't hear anything, but whoever did it could have used a muffler.  I'm innocent, though.\"\n\r\nCook: \"It's like the maid says.  She was cleaning the dining room while I tidied up the kitchen, and we both stored the leftovers in the refrigerator and talked for a few minutes about his guests.  I went upstairs and to my room about the same time she did, but fell asleep after I took a shower and brushed my teeth.  That was about eleven-thirty maybe, and I slept soundly until this morning, when a scream woke me.  I rushed downstairs with the others, and there was the body.  I tell you, I didn't do it.  I've been with Mr. Andrews for eight years, and he knows he can trust me.\"\n\r\nMandy: \"I was up until midnight with my uncle and his friends, talking and joking around.  I fell asleep at about one-fifteen, but woke at six-twenty-four, and was thirsty, so I went down to the kitchen to get a glass of water.  On the way back, I passed by the bay window, the one behind us, and I could see the beautiful sunrise outside, but, sadly, my uncle was sprawled on the ground, with a huge bloody wound on the side of his head.  I screamed and the others were here in just one or two minutes.\"\n\r\n\"That's enough,\" Carrie said abruptly, before the two friends of Mr. Andrews can say anything.  \"I know who did it.  Lieutenant!  We have our murderer!\"\n\r\nAll five suspects, and the lieutenant and her two men, who came into the room at her call, look at Carrie. \n\r\nWho murdered Steven Andrews, and how did Carrie know?",
        "options": [
            "A: Mandy killed her uncle.  It was afternoon when Carrie looked out the bay window and saw the sunset, so the window must have been facing the west.  However, Mandy claimed to have seen the sunrise through that same window, but the sun rises in the east.  Carrie learned from a distraught Mandy that they had argued recently, and she had come to settle their dispute, although Steven had already disowned her and refused to re-include her in his will, so, in a fit of anger, Mandy shot him with a revolver hidden in a kitchen cabinet for safety precautions.  Her uncle had also fancied a drink and was on his way down to the kitchen when she was taking her glass of water back upstairs.",
            "B: The maid killed Steven Andrews. Carrie realized this because despite the maid's testimony of sleeping soundly through the night, the maid mentioned hearing a muffler, which only someone awake and alert could have noticed. Carrie discovered discrepancies in her story, including a book found with pages marked that detailed a similar crime scenario, suggesting premeditation. However, despite her attempts to escape, the maid confessed after Carrie confronted her with evidence of a secretly purchased firearm, matching the murder weapon.",
            "C: The cook murdered Steven Andrews. Carrie deduced this after noticing inconsistencies in his timeline and a lack of genuine grief. Further investigation revealed that the cook had been recently fired by Mr. Andrews, but this was unknown to the others. Motivated by revenge and feeling betrayed after years of loyal service, the cook poisoned Mr. Andrews' last meal. However, the poison acted slower than he intended, and Mr. Andrews was attempting to seek help but succumbed in front of the bay window.",
            "D: One of Mr. Andrews' friends was the murderer. Carrie pinpointed this when she realized that despite their claims of sleeping through the night, one friend was an insomniac who often wandered around at night. This friend harbored a hidden resentment towards Mr. Andrews over a financial dispute that went sour years ago. A slip of the tongue regarding a detail of the crime scene that hadn't been disclosed to them yet revealed their guilt. Carrie found the evidence in the form of recorded threats left on Mr. Andrews' phone, clinching the case against the friend."

        "problem": "A road leading to a secret military base is 20 feet wide. Private Roberts was ordered to plant 20 land mines on the road in a 20-foot by 20-foot area. He laid out the area in a grid, with 100 2-foot squares arranged in 10 columns (running parallel with the road) and 10 rows (running perpendicular with the road).  He planted each land mine within a square on the grid so that there were exactly two mines in each row and two in each column. When he was finished, he found himself on the wrong side of the minefield, and he couldn't get back to the base without crossing the minefield. \n\r\nHe labeled the columns A-J from left to right, and numbered the rows 1-10 starting with the row closest to the base.  \n\r\n-- A B C D E F G H I J\r\n01X X X X X X X X X X\r\n02X X X X X X X X X X\r\n03X X X X X X X X X X\r\n04X X X X X X X X X X\r\n05X X X X X X X X X X\r\n06X X X X X X X X X X\r\n07X X X X X X X X X X\r\n08X X X X X X X X X X\r\n09X X X X X X X X X X\r\n10X X X X X X X X X X\n\r\nHe could remember the following facts about where the mines were planted:\n\r\n1.

        "options": [
            "A: Bass.\n   \n   Considering Beethoven's notable immersion in music, it's plausible to interpret his directions on a deeper level, reflective of his compositional complexity. Starting from 'D' and undertaking the journey through musical intervals might misleadingly suggest 'Bass', if one inaccurately cycles through the musical notes. This option hints at the richness of sound or perhaps the instrument itself, subtly weaving through the realm of music where 'Bass' feels at home, despite not being the accurate outcome of Beethoven's encoded message.",
            "B: Note.\n  \n   This option explores the fundamental elements of music, with Beethoven's riddle diving into the core of the musical scale represented by the letters \"ABCDEFG\". Progressing from 'D', and maneuvering through his specific instructions, one could mistakenly assemble 'Note' when misinterpreting the sequence of the musical scale. It's a simple error given the puzzle's reliance on navigating the octave intricacies, making 'Note' appear as a plausible yet erroneous conclusion.",
            "C: Deaf.\n\r\nBeethoven was a composer, obviously, and utilized the Musical Key in this teaser. When he says \"Go up Eleven\", he is referring to the letters \"ABCDEFG.\" Going up Eight notes from 'D' brings us to 'E' (because, of course, the musical scale simply repeats itself in the next octave). Going down Eleven notes brings us to 'A', and going up Five notes brings us to 'F'. Hence, DEAF (which, incidentally, Beethoven was).",
            "D: Beat.\n   \n   Beethoven was clever with his puzzles, using not just any code, but the musical alphabet as his guide. Starting from 'D' and following his unique directions, navigating through the eight and eleven steps on a musical scale can get tricky due to its cyclical nature. After wrapping around, these strategic movements seemingly spell out 'Beat', a nod perhaps to rhythm, an essential element of music. However, understanding the true path reveals 'Deaf' as the answer, ironically connecting to Beethoven's own fate."

There is no inflation, so Madadian wonks (local currency 100 winks = 1 wonk) are constant in value.\r\nMad Ade's cousin Manic Martin works as an accountant in one of Madadia's leading accounting firms.\r\nAfter his first year his salary was a straight 10,000 wonks, with which Manic Martin was quite happy. His manager was so impressed with his work he offered Manic Martin a wage rise.\r\nNow this being Madadia, things are not always done as they are elsewhere, the wage rise was offered over a 17.5 year contract period, These contracts are immutably binding, and will still be paid to benefactors in the event of death or permanent disability.\r\nManic Martin has a choice of how to receive his raise.  The first option was for an immediate 5% raise to 10,500 wonks annually, with an additional 5% raise every 6 months. The second option was for an immediate 10% raise to 11,000 wonks annually, with an additional 10% raise every year. Manic Martin's salary, based upon his current annual, was paid bi-weekly.\r\nWhich deal would benefit Manic Martin the most?",
        "options": [
            "A: Choosing a consistent 8% raise annually provides the most steady growth over time. At first glance, the balanced approach of steady, predictable increases each year seems to provide a reliable path to financial improvement. However, by the contract's end, this method falls short of the semi-annual 5% increase total by approximately 258.33 wonks, illustrating that a consistent rate does not always lead to the highest final accumulation in the world of compound interest and fixed intervals.",
            "B: The 5% semi-annual raise yields a higher return. \r\nThis may have been your first guess, but there is something odd about the answer. At the start of the problem, the 10% raise is earning more-  11,000 annually vs. 10,500. After the first year, the 5% option has earned 10,762 compared to 11,000. \n\r\nWhat are the two options earning at the moment the contract closes, after 17.5 years? Surprisingly, the 5% option only realizes a little more than 55,160, compared to the 10% option which is still ahead with just under 56,000. \n\r\nSo where's the advantage in the 5% option? It hides in the second half of every year. Even in the first year, the 5% option makes more in the second six months than the 10% option. For the first few years, this is not enough to offset the difference. But cumulatively, over seventeen and a half years, 5% realizes a grand total of 390.27 more than the 10% option. This in spite of the fact that the 10% option starts with a higher salary- and finishes with a higher salary.",
            "C: The immediate 10% annual raise followed by 5% semi-annual raises proves most beneficial. This structure starts strong with an 11,000 wonk base and increases moderately but steadily. By the end of the contract period, the cumulative advantage of the more frequent 5% increases seems significant. Unexpectedly, even though it catches up gradually, it surpasses the semi-annual 5% raises by a margin of approximately 202.50 wonks, making it an enticing but ultimately incorrect choice due to miscalculation of compounding intervals.",
            "D: Opting for an initial 15% raise with subsequent 7.5% increases every nine months is the most profitable. The allure of a high starting increase plus moderate and more frequent boosts throughout the contract suggests an appealing option. Yet, at the final assessment after 17.5 years, this scenario accumulates less than the 5% semi-annual raises by around 120 wonks, defying initial expectations and underlining the subtle impacts of compounding intervals on long-term gains."

As Dodge was Jamie's closest living relative, much of Jamie's estate was being left to him.\r\nOne day, Jamie went to Dr Dodge very disturbed. \"Doctor,\" he began, \"I have just found out that a man named Georgio wants to get me. He will be here very soon. Where will I go? Where can I hide? If he finds me in here, he will surely kill me. I do not have time to leave this clearing and go farther into the woods.\"\r\nDr Dodge thought for a moment, and then grabbed a 5' long bamboo pole, with a diameter the size of a quarter. \"Jamie, follow me out to the lake. This lake is 4' deep. If you lie on the bottom of the lake and breathe through this pole, Georgio will never find you. I will be in the bulrushes with a shotgun, and I will shoot him when he comes. I will swim down to find you when he is gone.\"\r\nJamie consented, and lay down on the bottom of the lake with the bamboo pole in his mouth. A few hours later, a ranger passed by. He found Jamie's body, dead. Dr Dodge told the police of the circumstance, and that Jamie had probably panicked, and died.\r\nPolice arrested Dr Dodge, on the charges of murdering Jamie.

When he exhaled, the air could not travel 5' before he breathed in again. He was just breathing what he exhaled. Before long, all he was breathing was carbon dioxide. He died of CO2 poisoning.\n\r\nDoctor Dodge was the one who told him to use the pole, therefore the cause of his death. Dodge is a DOCTOR, and therefore knows about the CO2. Dodge did murder Jamie. His motive: the money in the will.",

As Dr. Dodge was a doctor, he should have known that the body could not endure such pressure without proper gear. He suggested the plan, knowing the risk, which led to Jamie's demise. The underlying motive remained the inheritance.",

Dr. Dodge, being medically trained, should have anticipated the risk of hypothermia but still instructed Jamie to hide there.

        "problem": "Little Johnny, after a science lesson on the laws of gravity, returned home, determined to prove his teacher Mr. Knowles wrong.\n\r\n\"Not everything that goes up comes back down, and I'll prove it!\" After some brainstorming, he placed a bowl of water in the 12PM, windless, Sunday sun, and watched as it evapourated. \"It all went up,\" he said.\n\r\nThe next day at school, he confronted his teacher about his little science project. But Mr. Knowles told Little Johnny that he was a bit short sighted. How so?",
        "options": [
            "A: Little Johnny was incorrect in his assumptions because he failed to realize that the water, once evaporated, was immediately reused by plants in a process called transpiration, essentially moving from the bowl to nourish nearby vegetation. He should have sought advice from his biology teacher, who could have educated him about the cycle of water through ecosystems and how it supports life rather than leaving the Earth\u2019s surface forever.",
            "B: Little Johnny was mistaken because he overlooked the principle that water vapor, once evaporated, disperses into space and does not return to Earth. He should have consulted his astronomy teacher, who could have explained to him how Earth's atmosphere prevents certain particles from leaving but allows others, like water vapor, to escape into outer space.",
            "C: Little Johnny was short sighted because he had not waited to see the water come back down a few days later as rain or some other form of precipitation.(even if advection took place, the water would still come back down). Little Johnny should have consulted his geography teacher before doing the experiment. He would have learnt about the water cycle.",
            "D: Little Johnny was short sighted because he did not consider that the water evaporating was actually a chemical reaction, transforming it into a new substance that would not return to its original form. Little Johnny should have paid more attention during his chemistry lessons, where he would have learned about the permanent change some materials undergo when exposed to certain conditions."

        "problem": "The wedding reception was winding down as Bill Johnson, the father of the bride, held forth to anyone who was left to hear his report on the fiscal damages.\n\r\n\"That's the last one married off - thank goodness!   That's been one wedding a year for the last four years I've had to pay for.  Alice got married three years ago, then Barbara, Cheryl, and now Denise.  They've all gotten married on the same day, June 30th, for some reason, and each girl had to have her three sisters as the bridesmaids, but could they share a color scheme?  No - each one had to have her own colors. God forbid they should be able to reuse the bridesmaids' dresses, let alone share a wedding dress.  Alice tried to persuade Denise to reuse her color scheme, but Denise said she had lived with her older sister's hand-me-downs long enough.\n\r\nFunny thing, though - each bride managed to get married when her age was just the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of her three sisters.   You don't see that every day, I bet.  But why couldn't they share something that costs money instead of this trivia?\"\n\r\nBill didn't mention how old his daughters are, but he's given us enough information to work out all four ages.  How old are they?",
        "options": [
            "A: Alice is 27, Barbara is 28, Cheryl is 20, and Denise is 21, 21 = 2+7+2+8+2+0.\r\nA year ago, they were 26, 27, 19, and 20, 19 = 2+6+2+7+2+0.\r\nTwo years ago, they were 25, 26, 18, and 19, 26 = 2+5+1+8+1+9.\r\nThree years ago, they were 24, 25, 17, and 18, 24 = 2+5+1+7+1+8.\n\r\nYou can solve this one by trial and error (particularly with the hint), but you can also use the fact that any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:\r\nd = a + b + c (mod 9)\r\nc-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)\r\nb-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)\r\na-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).\n\r\nSolving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.\n\r\nIf we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.\n\r\nNow go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.\n\r\nNow consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.  But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister.  So Denise's digit sum must have been 2 last year, making Cheryl 19 then, and Denise 21 now.",

            "A: New York City's sidewalks are notoriously crowded, making the magician\u2019s claim implausible. Navigating through the bustling cityscape on one's hands for a mile and a half without interruption from pedestrians, street vendors, or other urban obstacles is highly unlikely.\n\nThe intricacies of New York City's pedestrian traffic, combined with the practical challenges of hand-walking amidst such a dynamic environment, cast doubt on the feasibility of the magician's performance. This aspect underscores the logistical improbabilities inherent in the claim, questioning its validity.",
            "B: The issue with the magician's claim lies in the distance covered. It is humanly impossible to walk on one's hands for a mile and a half without switching to walking on feet due to muscle fatigue and the need for balance restoration.\n\nWalking on one's hands for such an extended distance would require extraordinary physical strength and endurance, far beyond what is typically possible for performers, even those with significant acrobatic training and capabilities. The claim exaggerates human physical capacity and overlooks the physiological challenges associated with such a feat.",
            "C: There is no such thing as a cement sidewalk in New York City or anywhere else. \n\r\nSidewalks are made of concrete. Cement is merely one of the several ingredients that make up concrete. Concrete is made of sand, gravel, water, and finally cement, which is the active agent that binds all of the materials.",
            "D: The magician's claim is exaggerated as no documented evidence or witness accounts support this feat. In today\u2019s digital age, a unique performance like walking on hands for a mile and a half down a New York City sidewalk would likely attract media attention and social media sharing.\n\nWithout video footage, photographic evidence, or credible eyewitness testimonies to corroborate the magician\u2019s account, the claim remains unsubstantiated. The absence of verifiable proof in a scenario that would typically generate significant public interest and documentation makes the magician\u2019s assertion doubtful."

            "A: Define a, b, and c as the triangle's sides and s as its semiperimeter, thus s = (a + b + c) / 2. For the triangle's area, A, and the radius of the incircle, r, we find that separating the triangle into three smaller triangles by lines from vertices to incenter gives areas as ar/2, br/2, and cr/2. Thus, A = ar/2 + br/2 + cr/2 or A = sr. Heron's formula, A = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)), allows us to conclude that r = (s-a)(s-b)(s-c)/s^2. The radius of the circumscribed circle's formula, erroneously, is stated as Q = abc/2A.",
            "B: Let the sides of the triangle be denoted as a, b, and c. Define s as the semiperimeter, which calculates as s = (a + b + c) / 2. With A representing the area of the triangle and v the radius of the inscribed circle, we observe that A = sv. To determine v, we apply Heron's formula: A = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)). It results that v = s / sqrt((s-a)(s-b)(s-c)). The formula for the radius of the circumscribed circle we erroneously use is U = 4A / (abc), which is not the right approach.",
            "C: Let a, b, and c be the sides of the triangle. Let s be the semiperimeter, i.e., s = (a + b + c) / 2. Let A be the area of the triangle, and let y be the radius of the circumscribed circle. The formula for the radius of the incircle is given by y = A / s. Using Heron's formula for the area, A = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)), we find that y = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c))/s. For the radius of the inscribed circle, the formula is z = 4A / abc, which is incorrect.",
            "D: Let a, b, and c be the sides of the triangle. Let s be the semiperimeter, i.e. s = (a + b + c) / 2. Let A be the area of the triangle, and let x be the radius of the incircle. \n\r\nDivide the triangle into three smaller triangles by drawing a line segment from each vertex to the incenter. The areas of the smaller triangles are ax/2, bx/2, and cx/2. Thus, A = ax/2 + bx/2 + cx/2, or A = sx. \n\r\nWe use Heron`s formula, which is A = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)). This gives us x = sqrt((s-a)(s-b)(s-c)/s). \n\r\nThe radius of the circumscribed circle is given by R = abc/4A."

        "problem": "Aliens are placing you near one of two black holes in outer space.  They give you a choice of being placed near a large black hole or a small black hole.  Keeping in mind that when you go close to a black hole you must worry about large gravitational tidal forces produced by a black hole, which do you prefer, if you wish to escape?",
        "options": [
            "A: The medium-sized black hole. Tidal forces are sufficiently balanced for medium black holes, which are neither too large to extend the zone of deadly tidal effects too far from the event horizon, nor too small to intensify them prematurely. A medium-sized black hole, with a few hundred solar masses, presents a spatial gradient of gravitational forces that, while strong, might allow for a strategic approach toward the event horizon. The idea hinges on finding a 'sweet spot' where the forces do not yet spell certain doom, providing an opportunity (albeit slim) for escape.",
            "B: The small black hole. Tidal forces (near the event horizon) are more uniformly distributed in the vicinity of small black holes, because smaller black holes have a more concentrated mass, leading to a highly curved exterior spacetime. If you approached a black hole with a few solar masses, the gravitational forces would be equalized around you, making an escape more plausible due to the consistent pull. However, as you approach the horizon of a smaller black hole, tidal forces become incredibly intense, yet easier to predict than those produced by larger black holes. This predictability theoretically provides a narrow window for navigation away from the event horizon.",
            "C: The large black hole.  Tidal forces (near the event horizon) are smaller for large black holes than for small holes, because more massive black holes actually have a lower density, and the exterior spacetime is less curved. If you were approaching a 10-solar-masses black hole with a radius of 30 kilometers, you would be killed long before you reached the horizon at an altitude of 400 kilometers.  However, you could reach the horizon of a 1,000-solar-masses black hole.  The tidal forces at the horizon of this gigantic black hole would be weaker than those produced by Earth, which are already impossible for us to feel.  Of course, once you crossed the horizon, you would eventually be pulled into the singularity and then be torn to pieces by the finite tidal forces.  This final fate awaits you no matter what the mass of the black hole.",
            "D: Neither, as the tidal forces near black holes, regardless of their size, are uniformly lethal and there is no significant difference in survivability based on the mass or size of the black hole. Both large and small black holes exert such tremendous gravitational forces that any approach, let alone an escape, is fundamentally impossible. The misconception that one might be safer or more dangerous than the other overlooks the fact that the variance in tidal forces is negligible when compared to the overwhelming gravitational pull all black holes exert near their event horizons."

Moreover, Nora being born in October contradicts her wish for a birth month starting with a vowel, and Ophelia cannot be in December since her statement initiated the observation about mismatches between birth month initials and their own.",

Additionally, the clue saying the girl born in September doesn\u2019t mind her birth month cannot apply to Nora, as per her conversation. Ophelia\u2019s month also contradicts her statement that none of the sisters' birth month initials match their own initials, as Ophelia in October would violate this.",

However, with it not starting with a vowel, it cannot be October. Since she also spoke with the girl born in September, she cannot be born in September. Therefore, this arrangement leaves a contradiction. The girl born in September cannot be Nora. Given the dialogue between Ophelia and Nora, Dawn being born in November is incorrect because it clashes with the direct statements in the puzzle. Therefore, Sara and Ophelia's assigned months also do not follow logically from the clues provided in the puzzle.",

        "options": [
            "A: The presence of suspicious individuals in the area before the incident, coupled with the peculiar conduct of local authorities, led Nora to believe there was foul play. However, while indicative of possible criminal activity, these factors alone don't confirm arson as the cause of the fire, especially not taking into account the scientific reasoning related to La Paz's altitude and oxygen levels.",
            "B: La Paz is about 12,000 feet (3,660 meters) above sea level.  The partial pressure of oxygen is barely high enough to sustain an open fire.  La Paz bought fire engines only out of civic pride: the equipment generally gathers dust in the station.\n\r\nSince the flames went \"straight up to the sky\", this fire had help of some sort.  There was no significant wind to supply more oxygen, so someone must have \"made arrangements\" to make such a conflagration.\n\r\nUnfortunately, we don't have clues to figure out who did it.",
            "C: Nora deduced it from the unusual speed of the emergency response. Given the city's infrastructure and typical response times, the rapid arrival of fire services suggested premeditation or prior knowledge of the event. However, this correlation does not necessarily prove arson, nor does it address the unique environmental conditions of La Paz affecting fire behavior.",
            "D: The pattern and intensity of the fire, as observed and reported by eyewitnesses, hinted at an unnatural origin. Nora speculated that such a fierce blaze, appearing to consume everything with such ferocity, had to be the work of arson. Yet, without considering La Paz's altitude and the specific challenges it poses for sustaining a fire, this reasoning lacks the conclusive evidence needed to be certain of arson, neglecting the scientific basis for her certainty."

        "problem": "It was a long and dirty 20 years for the tunnel workers. Every day they got on the elevator and went numerous meters down into the earth to give their best performance. They were excellent workers too. The foreman of Palsha Mining Company was so proud of his employees, that he decided he wanted to show his proud gesture to them when the tunnel was finished. When it finally came to an end of the 20 years of digging, the foreman went down into the tunnel with champagne to throw them a toast. The foreman threw the toast and everyone sipped to it except for one tunnel worker. When the worker was asked why he didn't drink to the toast, he replied, \"I can't because I've been sober for 10 years. I do accept the nice gesture though.\" When the toast was finished, they went on the elevator to return to the surface to go home. However, all the workers were instantly sick when they got off the elevator besides the man who didn't drink.  I mean INSTANTLY! Why did the workers get sick so quickly and the man that couldn't drink the champagne didn't?",
        "options": [
            "A: Carbon Monoxide Poisoning! This occurs when individuals are exposed to high levels of carbon monoxide, a colorless, odorless gas that can be deadly. The workers' prolonged exposure to machinery exhaust within the confined environment of a tunnel could lead to a buildup of this gas in their bloodstream. Being in a deep tunnel, the ventilation might not have been sufficient, causing the workers to inhale more carbon monoxide over time. The champagne had no effect on the man who abstained, hence he wasn't sick like his colleagues. This could also explain the instantaneous sickness as the exposure's effects can emerge rapidly once the body's capacity to compensate is overwhelmed.",
            "B: The workers got sick due to a syndrome known as \"The Bends.\" This occurs when someone is under the surface at considerably depths breathing oxygen and coming up to the surface at a quick rate. The workers normally wouldn't have gotten sick due to the fact they didn't have any champagne while working. The champagne in the workers system takes a long time to digest also. When they reached the surface, the undigested champagne in their stomachs bubbled up due to the intense pressure change. The bubbling effect is caused by the carbonation in the liquid and the oxygen toxicity. When the pressure changed, oxygen bubbles formed and went into the workers bloodstream causing \"The Bends.\"  This is the same syndrome that divers can get. Think of it like a soda can. When it's shaken up, the can looks relatively normal. After it's opened however, it sprays everywhere.",
            "C: Psychological Stress Reaction! This is a condition where individuals experience physical symptoms as a result of extreme stress or psychological factors rather than physical causes. The workers, having been under intense, prolonged stress for 20 years, could have experienced a collective psychosomatic response upon the culmination of their project. The realization of their long-term commitment's abrupt end combined with the ceremonial acknowledgment of their foreman might have triggered a stress response. The abstaining worker, who did not partake in the champagne toast, might have had a different psychological state, focusing on his sobriety rather than the project's conclusion, which could have spared him from the immediate sickness experienced by the others.",
            "D: Sudden Altitude Sickness! This illness occurs when people ascend too quickly to high elevations, where the air is thinner and oxygen levels are lower. The workers, having been in a deep tunnel for an extended period, might have adapted to its lower oxygen levels. Upon quickly returning to the surface, their bodies could not adjust swiftly to the higher oxygen concentration, causing symptoms that mimic those of altitude sickness. However, the abstaining worker might have had a better physiological adaptation or less sensitivity to these rapid changes, hence not falling ill like his colleagues."

Their range extended to waters off Greenland, Iceland, and Europe. They could not fly, and this made them vulnerable to fishermen and sailors who easily killed them for food or bait. The only known nesting colonies off North America were at Funk Island, (Funk Island colony was last recorded in 1785) a small rocky outcropping east of Newfoundland, and Bird Rocks in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.  On June 3, 1844, at Eldey Rock off Iceland, the last known pair in the world were seen  and shot.\n\r\nPassenger Pigeon - These birds were so abundant that they comprised more than a quarter of the US bird population. They were used for food, and were very popular in restaurants.  The last major pigeon nestings occurred near the eastern shore of Lake Michigan in 1881 and in Wisconsin in 1882. The last Passenger Pigeon died at the Cincinnati Zoo in 1914. \n\r\nIvory-billed Woodpecker - These birds lived in the wet bottomlands of the virgin forest, habitat much like that of the Carolina parakeet. The beetles and grubs that infested dead and dying trees were their principle foods. When the forests disappeared, so did the Ivory-billed Woodpecker. \n\r\nLabrador Duck - Only 54 museum specimens of this bird exist. Not much is known about the Labrador Duck. It is reported that it was hunted for market between 1840 and 1860. This may have contributed to its extinction. \n\r\nCarolina Parakeet - Cypress swamps and other wet, wooded bottomlands were home to the Carolina parakeet. It roosted inside large, hollow trees and fed on the seeds of the different forest trees and shrubs. This bird quickly disappeared wherever settlers encroached. They were hunted for their plumage and captured to sell as cage birds. They were said to become tame in 2 days. The last known bird died in 1914 in the Cincinnati Zoo.\n\r\nHeath Hen - Now considered a race of the greater prairie chicken, the \"heath hen\" lived on dry coastal plains. It foraged widely on berries, seeds, nuts and insects. As early as 1791, the danger of overhunting was recognized. Over the years, different laws were enacted  to protect this bird, but by 1932, they were gone. \n\r\nBachman's Warbler - It is not certain that Bachman's Warbler is extinct, but it is probable. Continuing into the 1900's, nests were discovered, but the clearing of the bottomland forest reduced the bird's habitat, and the population seriously diminished by the 1930's, never to recover. The last specimen was taken in 1949 in Mississippi. Sightings of varying reliability extend into the 1980's, with photographs of a male taken near Charleston, SC, in 1958. An extensive search in the late 1970's did not reveal any birds.",

            "A: I am Tetris Block.\nI am not chased but instead must fit into spaces to clear lines and prevent the screen from filling up. My \"energy bursts\" come from completing lines, not from eating dots. The challenge I present is spatial reasoning and quick thinking, not navigating mazes and avoiding ghosts.\n\nI can take multiple shapes, including squares and long rectangles, not a singular, circular form. Players rotate and move me to fit into the playing field, a far cry from guiding a character through a maze.\n\nThe challenge I pose is against the increasing speed and complexity of the game, not adversaries like Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde. My gameplay is singular and straightforward, focusing on accumulation and clearing, distinct from the varied and escalating levels faced by Pac-Man.",
            "B: I am Mario.\nI am known for jumping on creatures, not being chased by them. I power up by grabbing mushrooms and fire flowers, not by eating dots. I do navigate through various levels, but my main goal is saving the princess, not clearing dots from a maze.\n\nI am not a circular shape, but a plumber with a distinctive hat and mustache. Players control my movements directly, navigating me through different worlds rather than a single maze.\n\nWhile I do face various enemies, my adversaries are Goombas, Koopas, and Bowser, not Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde. My adventures span multiple kingdoms, each with its unique challenges, far beyond just avoiding ghosts in a maze.",
            "C: I am Link.\nI am known for exploring vast landscapes and dungeons, not being confined to a maze. My energy comes from hearts found during my adventures, not from dots. The quest I embark on involves solving puzzles, battling creatures, and ultimately rescuing Princess Zelda, not clearing mazes of dots.\n\nI carry a sword and shield and wear a green tunic, not a yellow, circular form. Players guide me through a variety of environments using more than just simple directional inputs, engaging in combat and exploration.\n\nMy adversaries include Ganon and his minions, not the ghostly quartet of Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde. My journey takes me across the land of Hyrule, which is teeming with secrets and challenges beyond merely evading spectral foes.",

I eat all of the dots for the first level, but as I progress in the game, there are so many levels with these dots that it is hard to eat them all.\n\r\nI am a circle, and need help moving around. People often tell me which way to go through intersections as I would get stuck by the walls otherwise.\n\r\nPeople also try to help me avoid the creatures, but many fail as the 256 levels get to be overwhelming."

Additionally, the concept of being primarily one gender over the other due to genetic traits does not apply to fish in the same way it does to calico cats.",

However, unlike a calico cat, a Bengal Tiger is not known for a diet that includes items that could also be considered toys. Additionally, tigers can be both male and female without the gender rarity seen in calico cats.",

However, it does not consume items that could double as toys, distinguishing it from the calico cat. While spiders can exhibit differences in coloration based on sex, the gender-specific genetic trait leading to a prevalence of females over males, as seen in calico cats, is not present in the peacock spider.",

        "options": [
            "A: Phil thinks covering the pot with aluminum foil could reflect heat back into the pot, thus cooking the spaghetti faster. While he's at it, he could also attempt to cook the spaghetti in standing position, theorizing that having the ends submerged would cook them first and the rest would cook as the strands soften and sink, although this could result in unevenly cooked pasta.",
            "B: He decides to split the spaghetti into smaller segments before adding them to the pot, believing this will speed up the cooking process by increasing the exposure of the pasta to hot water. Additionally, he might consider stirring the pasta more frequently to distribute the heat evenly, even though this could potentially make the pasta stick together or cook unevenly.",
            "C: He could use less water to reduce the heating time, although this might risk not cooking the spaghetti thoroughly. In theory, he might also place a lid tightly on the pot to help retain heat, but given the altitude, this could lead to water spilling over due to increased boiling intensity.",
            "D: He adds a lot of salt to the water to increase the boiling point (actually, anything that would dissolve would do that, but he prefers salt). In theory he could also round the bottom edge of his pot by grinding it (which would also increase the surface area exposed to hot air because of roughness), but he'd probably spend more time doing that than he'd save on cooking time."

Mrs. Tory told her husband that they owed the liquor store $100, so he gave the bill to his wife to pay the liquor store. The owner of the liquor store owed the butcher $100, so he gave the bill to the butcher, who then went to a farmer, and purchased a lamb with the $100. The farmer remembered he owed the finance company $100, so he took the same bill to them to pay his debt. Upon careful examination, Mr. Tory discovered that the bill was counterfeit. By this time, the $100 bill had paid $400 in debt. Which transactions turn sour and who loses what?",
        "options": [
            "A: Since the identical counterfeit bill can be traced through all the transactions, they are all invalid. Therefore, everybody stands in relation to their respective debts as they were before Mr. Tory found the counterfeit bill.  This being the case, the farmer is entitled to his lamb or $100.",

He got 10 candles, a pot, and a blow torch. His idea worked rather well too. \n\r\nDuffus didn't use the candles or the torch for light as most people would; no he did something quite different to keep from cutting himself. \n\r\nWhat did Duffus do ?",
        "options": [
            "A: Duffus decided to use the blow torch to slightly dull the edges of the most dangerous tools, ensuring they would be less likely to cut him on retrieval. Metalworkers and tool manufacturers sometimes perform a controlled dulling process to ensure safety during shipping and handling. When needing to use the tools, Duffus would simply sharpen them again, thus maintaining their efficacy for their intended tasks.",

Educational programs on tool safety advocate for a similar color-coding system to help users quickly identify and use the tools safely. Upon grabbing a tool, the color of the handle would remind him of the caution he needed to maintain.",
            "C: Duffus used the candles to create a reflective light system, arranging them to light up the shed indirectly. He believed by reducing the harsh shadows, he could better see and avoid the sharp tools. Industrial designers often construct light diffusion systems for similar safety reasons. When entering the shed, the reflected light would illuminate the space softly, allowing for better visibility without direct light.",

Industrial suppliers of  saw blades and cutting equipment use a similar method to coat and protect sharp edges. When the item is first used, the wax simply peels off. Then when finished with the blade he can simply reapply the wax."

If you have any better reason for switching, leave a comment.",
            "B: Here's another angle: Assuming the alternate envelope might hold either $400 or $100, the decision to switch hinges on the anticipation of gaining more money. The mental gymnastics to rationalize switching, due to the potentially higher amount in the other envelope, fails to account for the fundamental equal likelihood of either envelope containing the lesser or greater amount. This reasoning falls prey to the common misunderstanding of the two-envelope paradox by overestimating the benefits of switching based on incomplete consideration of the probabilities.",
            "C: Consider this: The other envelope might contain either $400 or $50, making your current envelope seem possibly less valuable. With this calculation, switching seems advantageous because your expected gain appears more significant. This approach, however, neglects the original premise that the other envelope can only have a 50/50 chance of containing either double or half of your current amount, leading you astray from the correct reasoning about the probabilities involved.",
            "D: Reflect on the possibility: If the envelope you did not pick contains either $400 or $100, you're facing a challenging decision. By not switching, you risk missing out on potentially doubling your money. This thought process seems to suggest that switching might be a beneficial gamble since the lure of doubling your winnings is compelling. However, this ignores the underlying paradox of the two-envelope problem, which implies that your initial choice shouldn't have a significant impact on whether you decide to switch or not."

        "problem": "The bridge was covered with a fresh blanket of snow. Only one set of footprints led to the woman's body lying in the middle of the bridge. Mike, a detective, knew from the one set of footprints that this was suicide, yet he couldn't find the weapon used. Mike discovered powder burns on the dead woman's chest and a small chip out of the railing where the snow had been brushed away. The dead woman's footprints were all around this area. The only other clue was that 10 metres down, and directly below the chip of paint on the railing, was a hole in the ice. How did the woman manage to kill herself instantly, yet still dispose of the weapon?",
        "options": [
            "A: Mike reasoned that the woman had a rope to which she secured a weight to one end and the gun to the other. She then dropped the weight over the bridge. When the woman shot herself, she automatically released the gun. As the weight fell, it pulled the gun which hit the railing, causing the small chip mark. The movement of the rope and gun explain why the snow was brushed away from the railing. The hole in the ice was caused by the falling weight.",
            "B: Mike surmised that the woman had attached the gun to a balloon filled with helium. After shooting herself, the gun ascended, carrying the weapon away from the scene. The chip out of the railing was thought to be made by the gun\u2019s recoil or by the woman's aimless movements preceding her death.",
            "C: Mike hypothesized that the woman had used a specially designed biodegradable gun that dissolved upon contact with snow. After firing the shot, the gun fell from her hand, landing in the snow where it quickly disintegrated. The chip in the railing occurred as a minor, unrelated incident sometime before the event.",
            "D: Mike deduced that the woman utilized a complex mechanism involving a spring-loaded arm attached to the railing. After shooting herself, the spring mechanism was activated, flinging the gun into the river. The chip in the railing and brushed-away snow were caused by the activation of this mechanism, and the hole in the ice was pure coincidence, unrelated to the disposal of the weapon."

When trying to quantify:\n\n[1,2,3,4,5,6,7....] [x,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8....]\n\nThis approach suggests a misunderstanding that infinity plus one is beyond mathematical comparison to infinity, viewing infinity as a philosophical construct rather than acknowledging its grounding in quantitative analyses.

You could represent them like this:\n\n[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8....] [x,1,2,3,4,5,6,7....]\n\nPlacing the X at the start demonstrates that the second group prematurely gains an additional member, suggesting a greater quantity.

The Series is scheduled so that one team hosts the first two games and the last two games, while the other team hosts the middle three games.  The World Series ends as soon as one team wins four games, so the Series could be completed in as few as four games.\n\r\nIn this fantasy Series, the New York Yankees played the Los Angeles Dodgers.

It does not matter who won each of the first six games, since neither team had yet to win four games.  The winner of game 7 will have won four games, and therefore, the World Series.\n\r\nThe team that hosts the first two games also hosts the last two games.  Since Los Angeles hosted the first two games, game 7 was in Los Angeles.  In baseball, the home team bats last.  Los Angeles batted last in game 7.  Since game 7 went 13 innings, Los Angeles would have batted in the bottom of the inning.  In this situation, the home team can never win by more than four runs.  When the home team bats in the last inning, the game ends as soon as the winning run is scored.  The only way the home team can win by more than one run is via a home run, in which case all runners on base at the time can score.  A grand slam home run would only provide a margin of four runs.  Therefore, the home team's margin of victory in an extra-inning game can never exceed four runs.  The final score was 13 to 8, a margin of five runs.  Los Angeles, being the home team, could not have won by that margin.  The game was tied 8 to 8 going into the 13th inning.  New York scored five runs in the top of the 13th inning.\n\r\nTherefore, the New York Yankees won the World Series, four games to three.",

This option introduces a scenario that, while it may sound plausible to those unfamiliar with the strict structure of the World Series, does not adhere to the established rules governing the championship's resolution.",
            "C: The Series resulted in a tie, with both teams winning three games each. Analyzing the sequence of games and their outcomes, one might reason that since a total of seven games were played, there might have been some unusual circumstance that prevented a definitive winner from being declared after game 7.

Reviewing the series, seven games were played, indicating a tightly contested matchup where the teams were tied after the first six games.

However, given the intricacies of baseball rules and the scenario presented, the conclusion might seem that Los Angeles won; this would misunderstand the significance of the final game's run margin and the rule stipulating how the home team can win in extra innings, leading to the incorrect conclusion."

            "C: Mike is the victim.\n\r\nIf Mike's sister and Jack's sister are the same person, then (a) reads \"Lily argued exactly once with (Mike or Jack)\" and (b) reads \"Lily argued twice with (the same Mike or Jack)\".  These two statements contradict each other.  Therefore Mike's sister must be different from Jack's sister.\r\nIf this is the case then there are two possibilities:\n\r\n1)  Jack and Carol are brother and sister.  Mike and Lily are brother and sister.  Jack is married to Lily and Mike is married to Carol.  If this is the case, then (a) reads \"Carol argued once with Mike\" and (b) reads \"Lily argued twice with herself\", leaving Jack dead.  Since Lily did not likely argue with herself, this is not the solution.\n\r\n2)  Jack and Lily are brother and sister.  Mike and Carol are brother and sister.  Jack is married to Carol and Lily is married to Mike.  If this is the case, then (a) reads \"Lily argued once with Jack\" and (b) reads \"Carol argued twice with Lily\", leaving Mike dead.  Since there are no contradictions, this is the solution.",
            "D: Lily is the victim.\n\n   Assuming here that Carol and Mike are siblings for this hypothesis, and taking into account that Jack marries Lily, we misinterpret (a) as \"Carol argued exactly once with Jack,\" and (b) could misleadingly be seen as \"Mike argued twice with Jack,\" implying Lily could be the victim. However, this reconstruction of relationships does not hold up under scrutiny with the given facts, proving this option to be incorrect as well."

What should you do to get the best deal?\n\r\nAssume that the actual number of steaks you purchase is of no concern, except for the butcher's deal.

Ordering all twelve would mean that you paid $4 per steak, averaging $5 each in value.  You saved $1 per steak.\n\r\nHowever, if you order all 12 then you are technically choosing the steaks (because saying \"give me all of them\" is just a shorter way of saying \"give me that one, and that one, and...\"), so you would have to ask for 11 and let the butcher pick them at his discretion.",

Using the information provided on  the table below, can you determine how many C's you need to balance the \"A\" on Scale 4?

Scale 3 reveals that 2L is comparable to 3B, hence forming the basis that 3B equals 2C + 2A.\n   \n   3. Upon adding 1C to each side of the equation, it transforms to 3B + 1C equating to 3C + 2A.\n   \n   4. Considering the equivalence on Scale 2, where 1B + 1C matches 1A, it leads to a conclusion that 2A + 1A equals 4C + 2A.\n   \n   5. Removing the common variables, the simplified form is A = 4C, indicating that 4C is needed to balance an A on Scale 4.",

Observing Scale 3 closely, you replace 2L with 3B which suggests that 3B should equate directly to 1C + 1A.\n   \n   3. By integrating 2C into the equation, it's assumed that 3B + 2C is equivalent to 3C + 1A.\n   \n   4. Reflecting on Scale 2, you deduce that 1B + 1C equals 1A, leading to the interpretation that 2A should equal 3C.\n   \n   5. The final step involves simplifying to A = 3C, suggesting that you need 3C to balance 1A on Scale 4.",

By checking out Scale 3 you know that you can replace 2L in the above equation with 3B: 3B = 2C + 2A.\n\r\n3. Add 3C to each side.  Now 3B + 3C = 5C + 2A.\n\r\n4. By checking Scale 2, you can replace each C + B with A:  3A = 5C + 2A.\n\r\n5. Subtract 2A from both sides, and get A = 5C.",

From Scale 3's information, substituting 2L with 3B translates to 3B equaling 1C + 1A.\n   \n   3. By infusing an additional C into the equation, it morphs into 3B + 1C having the same weight as 2C + 1A.\n   \n   4. When Scale 2's balance is evaluated, replacing B + C with A seemingly equates 2A to 2C + 1A.\n   \n   5. After refinement, the equation narrows down to A equals 2C. Therefore, it concludes that 2C is necessary to maintain equilibrium with an A on Scale 4."

Unfortunately, every time he performs one of his plays, the critics always pick out something that is wrong with it.\n\r\nTheo was getting desperate. He needed a foolproof idea. He had decided to do a show where nothing could go wrong and which also had some international appeal!\n\r\nIt was the sad tale about a poor Irish boy who grew up in a poverty-stricken town, set during the times when people were flocking to live the 'American Dream' in America. Theo's character decided to do the same. Theo's main monologue came at the midway point his character's voyage to America.\n\r\n\"Here I am,\" Theo started, \"I'm finally making my own decisions in life! This is unreal. I can't believe it. You hear about people doing this sort of thing, but never in a million years did I ever think I would. They say the first man-made thing you see is that new Statue of Liberty, far in the distance. Then you land, and they take you to Ellis Island to be cataloged! Y'know, to make sure you don't bring a disease to the country and so they know who you are. Cataloged! Can you imagine me being cataloged? Look! There it is! You see? In the distance? That green blob, right there! The first thing I see...\" Theo's eyes started to well up with tears. \"Here I am. I can't believe this. There she is. You can see her green face now. She's smiling at me. This is so surreal...\"\n\r\nThe curtains came down and there was a thunderous applause! This was it; Theo knew he had finally beaten the critic and written a flawless play.\n\r\nAfter everyone had left, Theo met up with the critic. Theo was somewhat smug about himself.\n\r\n\"So,\" he said, \"What did you think? There were absolutely no mistakes in that show.\"\n\r\n\"Actually, Theo,\" the critic answered, \"there were 2 mistakes! I'm most certainly going to have to give you a bad review this time!\"\n\r\nThe critic then left Theo standing somewhat bewildered. What mistakes had Theo made?",
        "options": [
            "A: Firstly, the Statue of Liberty is not the first thing the immigrants would've seen when voyaging to America. It was, in fact, Lucy the Elephant, a giant elephant-shaped building on Coney Island. It was built by James V. Lafferty Jr., who held a patent for animal-shaped buildings!\n\r\nSecondly, when it was newly built, the statue was not green as it is today. The statue was coated with a thin layer of copper, which was originally a very dark brown colour. Over time, all copper which was left outside began developing a thin, green coating called Copper Patina. This happens when acids in the rain react with the copper. It took 20 years for the Statue of Liberty to get its current colour.",
            "B: Firstly, the notion that the Statue of Liberty was the first man-made object seen by immigrants is incorrect. Immigrants would first sight the Brooklyn Bridge, a symbol of American engineering prowess, before viewing the statue.\n\nSecondly, the Ellis Island registration process did not originally involve the extensive cataloging of immigrants' backgrounds upon their immediate arrival, as significant vetting occurred prior to departure from their home countries. This included health inspections and document verification.",
            "C: Firstly, the Statue of Liberty was actually a gift from the French people and was supposed to be a symbol of freedom and democracy, not a welcoming figure for immigrants. The actual purpose was largely misconceived by the general public over time.\n\nSecondly, the statue's pedestal was funded through a campaign in the United States, which required a significant effort to gather donations. This challenge led to delays in the statue's assembly and its unveiling, which was not broadly publicized until a later time.",
            "D: Firstly, the trip to Ellis Island didn't include a direct view of the Statue of Liberty, as it was often obscured by mist from the ocean. It was only visible from a closer range upon nearing the Ellis Island.\n\nSecondly, Ellis Island wasn't actually the primary processing center for immigrants until several years after the Statue of Liberty was erected, initially, they were processed at Castle Garden Immigration Depot which was located at the southern tip of Manhattan."

            "A: Mouthwash!\n   Explanation:\n   1. Mouthwash comes in various formulas, some of which might be too strong and cause discomfort if misused.\n   2. Regular use of mouthwash is necessary for complete oral hygiene, complementing brushing. Avoiding it may not directly increase costs but can contribute to conditions that might.\n   3. Unlike a toothbrush, mouthwash doesn't involve physical contact, but its absence can lead to increased plaque and potential oral health fights.\n   4. Using mouthwash for a short period daily can offer significant benefits against germs and leftover food particles, akin to the toothbrush's action against \"cheese.\"\n   5. Overuse or misuse of mouthwash, especially those with high alcohol content, can lead to irritation or other side effects. The choice and usage frequency largely depend on the user.\n   6. Consistent and proper use of mouthwash supports dental health, whose benefits, like those of toothbrushing, are more appreciable in the long run.",
            "B: A toothbrush. \n\r\nExplanation: \r\n1. Toothbrushes come in many sizes; and if you misuse a toothbrush, it could hurt your gums. \n\r\n2. Toothbrushes should be used everyday. If you do not use a toothbrush often, you will need to more frequently visit the dentist and other mouth care professionals which costs money. \n\r\n3. Toothbrushes will not bite you. If you do not use a toothbrush regularly, it may give you gingivitis or other mouth related problems which your body will need to fight. \n\r\n4. You can use a toothbrush for a couple minutes which is a short time for its big benefits. The cheese is referring to leftover food still in your mouth which a toothbrush can help remove. \n\r\n5. Sometimes if you brush too hard it could cause bleeding. Since you are the person leading the brush strokes, you have to control how much pressure you are using to avoid this. \n\r\n6. The more you take your time, the healthier your mouth will be. If you use a toothbrush frequently now, later in life, you will be thankful because it will help you avoid any gum diseases you could have acquired had you not used a toothbrush.",
            "C: Floss!\n   Explanation:\n   1. Floss comes in various thicknesses and types; incorrect usage can harm your gums or teeth.\n   2. Dental floss should be used daily to remove plaque and food particles between teeth. Neglecting its use could lead to dental issues, increasing healthcare expenses.\n   3. Floss, like a toothbrush, won't cause harm if used correctly. Avoiding flossing might lead to dental diseases that require more intensive treatment.\n   4. A few minutes of flossing can significantly contribute to oral hygiene. It effectively cleans areas a toothbrush might miss, similar to removing \"cheese\" between teeth.\n   5. Improper flossing can sometimes cause gums to bleed, especially if done with too much force. The user controls the pressure and technique, thus playing a crucial role in the process.\n   6. Regular and careful flossing contributes to long-term oral health. Like toothbrushing, it is an investment in preventing future dental problems.",
            "D: Dental Pick!\n   Explanation:\n   1. Dental picks come in different types, with some designed for specific uses; incorrect usage can injure gums or damage tooth enamel.\n   2. While not a substitute for brushing, regular use of dental picks can help maintain oral cleanliness. Neglecting their use doesn't necessarily cost more money but can contribute to dental issues over time.\n   3. Dental picks, being tools, do not bite. However, if not used, plaque and tartar can accumulate, leading to gum diseases and other oral health issues requiring professional intervention.\n   4. A few minutes spent using a dental pick can help clear out stubborn food debris and plaque, much like a toothbrush deals with \"cheese.\"\n   5. If used with improper pressure or angle, dental picks can sometimes cause the gums to bleed. The user's skill and care are critical in preventing such outcomes.\n   6. Taking the time to use a dental pick properly can significantly contribute to one's oral health, ensuring long-term benefits and potentially reducing the need for dental treatments."

        "options": [
            "A: x = number that like math teasers. \n2x = number that like rebus teasers. \nTo determine the total number of brainiacs that like either type of teaser, we combine those that like math teasers with those that like rebus teasers, remembering to adjust for those who like both or neither. \nMATH + REBUS - BOTH + NEITHER = 100. \nx + 2x - 18 + 4 = 100. \nThis simplifies to: \n3x - 14 = 100, which implies that x = 36. \nSo, 36 brainiacs are fans of math teasers. However, considering that 18 of these individuals also enjoy rebus teasers, we find that 18 brainiacs favor math teasers exclusively.",
            "B: 20 \n\r\nx = number that like math. \n\r\n2x = number that like rebus. \n\r\nAdd the number that like math to the number that like rebus. \r\nWe then must subtract off the number that likes both kinds of teasers and add the number that doesn't like either. The result will be equal to 100. \n\r\nMATH + REBUS - BOTH + NEITHER = 100 . \n\r\nx + 2x - 18 + 4 = 100. \n\r\nSo: \n\r\n3x - 14 = 100, and so x = 38. \n\r\nThus 38 like math teasers, but of that number 18 also like rebus teasers. That leaves 20 that like only the math teasers.",
            "C: Consider x as the number of brainiacs favoring math teasers, while twice this number, 2x, favors rebus teasers. \nTo find the total engaging with at least one type of teaser, the formula is set as: \nMATH + REBUS - BOTH + NEITHER = 100. \nHence, x + 2x - 18 + 4 = 100. \nSimplifying gives: \n3x - 14 = 100, and solving for x gives us 38. \nTherefore, 38 like math teasers. Considering that 18 enjoy both rebus and math teasers, it leaves us with 20 preferring rebus teasers but not math teasers, which is a subtle misinterpretation of the question's requirement.",
            "D: Let x represent the number of brainiacs who enjoy math teasers, and 2x represents those who prefer rebus teasers. \nThe equation to find the total number of brainiacs based on their preferences is: \nMATH + REBUS - BOTH + NEITHER = 100. \nTherefore, x + 2x - 18 + 4 = 100. \nBy solving this, we get: \n3x - 14 = 100, leading us to x = 42. \nThis reveals that 42 brainiacs have a preference for math teasers. Subtracting the 18 that like both kinds leaves us with 24 brainiacs who only enjoy math teasers."

Nuclear fusion which tends to blow the star's hydrogen outward from the star's center and gravitation which tends to pull all hydrogen back in the direction it had come. These two processes balance one another until all the star's hydrogen is exhausted, allowing gravitation to take over. Once gravitation dominates, the star becomes unstable and starts to collapse. Once the star starts to collapse, it does not stop, and the star and ultimately its atoms will cave inward upon itself, resulting in the formation of a black hole. In addition, a collision of two older black holes or two neutron stars will also result in the creation a new black hole. Astronomers have also recently learned that the center of our Milky Way galaxy harbors a black hole and have found three other galaxies that also each harbor a black hole as well.",
            "C: Neutron Star. \nAn astrophysical object characterized by its incredibly dense composition, primarily consisting of closely packed neutrons. It is the remains of a massive star that has ended its life in a supernova explosion and collapsed under its gravity, but it is not massive enough to become a black hole. Neutron stars exhibit extreme gravitational fields, though not as intense as those of black holes, allowing them to distort the space and time around them. Despite their powerful gravitational pull, they emit radiation and can be detected by telescopes, unlike black holes which are invisible and can only be observed through their effects on surrounding matter.",
            "D: Supernova. \nA cosmic phenomenon marked by the exquisite explosion of a star, resulting in an extremely bright, short-lived object that emits vast amounts of energy. During this process, a star undergoes a catastrophic collapse after exhausting its nuclear fuel, leading to an explosion that can outshine entire galaxies for a brief period. While supernovae mark the end of a star's life cycle, they are also crucial for dispersing elements across the cosmos, contributing to the formation of new stars and planets. However, unlike black holes, they do not result in a singular point of infinite density and gravity where light cannot escape."

To make it easier for the store, they needed to find out how many CDs were in each different style of music. 25% were blues, 15% were pop, 25% were classical and 15% were rock. The remaining 24 CD's are jazz. \r\nHow many CDs are in each style? \r\nHow many CDs are there in total?",
        "options": [
            "A: In this alternative calculation, we neglect to subtract the combined percentage from 100%, incorrectly adding an additional genre to fill the perceived 'gap'. Assuming Jazz CDs represent 20%, but accidentally accounting for 20 jazz CDs instead of 24, we thus divide 20 by 20 to obtain 1 CD per percent. Consequently, multiplying by the percentages yields: Blues: 25% x 1 = 25 CDs Pop: 15% x 1 = 15 CDs Classical: 25% x 1 = 25 CDs Rock: 15% x 1 = 15 CDs This calculation incorrectly suggests a different distribution and leads to an erroneous total of 100 CDs in total.",
            "B: First you add up the percents: \r\n25% + 15% + 25% + 15% = 80% \n\r\nSubtract 80% from 100% to get 20% (the percentage of jazz CDs). \n\r\nDivide 24 by 20 to get 1.2 (that is, 1% corresponds to 1.2 CDs) then multiply the percentages by 1.2 to get how many CDs are in each musical style. \r\nBlues: 25% x 1.2 = 30 CDs \r\nPop: 15% x 1.2 = 18 CDs \r\nClassical: 25% x 1.2 = 30 CDs \r\nRock: 15% x 1.2 = 18 CDs \r\nThese are the answers to the first question. \n\r\nTo find the second answer: \r\n30 + 18 + 30 + 18 + 24 = 120 CDs in total.",
            "C: First, we calculate the totals of percentages already known: 25% + 15% + 25% + 15% = 75%. Surmising from the data, 25% of the CDs are jazz. Thus, dividing 24 by 25 gives us 0.96, which approximates each percentage point. Multiplying this factor by the respective percentages, we obtain: Blues: 25% x 0.96 = 24 CDs Pop: 15% x 0.96 = 14.4 CDs Classical: 25% x 0.96 = 24 CDs Rock: 15% x 0.96 = 14.4 CDs Summing these with the jazz CDs gives a total of 101.2 CDs, rounding down gives a plausible yet incorrect total of 101 CDs in total.",
            "D: In this calculation, we mistakenly assume that the sum of the provided percentages is 85%, leaving 15% for jazz. Therefore, with 24 jazz CDs accounting for 15%, we divide 24 by 15 to derive 1.6 CDs per percentage. Multiplying each genre's percentage: Blues: 25% x 1.6 = 40 CDs Pop: 15% x 1.6 = 24 CDs Classical: 25% x 1.6 = 40 CDs Rock: 15% x 1.6 = 24 CDs Adding these totals, alongside the jazz CDs, yields an incorrect combined total of 152 CDs in total."

This offers a variation where P, Q, and R's expertise as bomb-experts are more flexibly utilized, leading to 7 possible groups.",

Since two bomb-experts are to be chosen from P, Q, and R, and P & R prefer to work together, they will form the bomb-expert team in each group.

Hence, the possible groups are: PR - S - UV, PR - S - UW, PR - S - VW, PR - T - UV, PR - T - VW, and PR - T - UW. These considerations lead to a total of 6 different groups, as T's inclusion directly depends on V being selected as a soldier.",

This assumes that while P & R have a preference to work together, there are scenarios where Major Steve could ignore their preference for the benefit of the mission's flexibility. Additionally, considering T\u2019s condition to only work if V is included, the arrangement of groups expands. Possible groups could include variations where P and Q; R and Q; or P and R work as bomb-experts, alongside different leadership and soldier combinations that respect T's preference for working with V.

Unfortunately, ever since her pet goldfish, Silky, passed away and had to be turned over to Mr. Toilet, Sue has had some very interesting dreams. She keeps dreaming Silky is kidnapped on his way to Fish Heaven from Mr. Toilet by some very tricky Goo-monsters, and it's up to Sue to save him (lucid dreaming helps...)!\n\r\nSue is ready to go to bed, knowing she will once again dream of her good friend, Silky. Just as she closes her little eyes and goes to sleep, the Goo-monsters appear. Oh no! They have Silky trapped in a sealed aquarium! The Goo-monsters throw the key into a little ciphered box, and leave poor Silky trapped between Earth and Fish Heaven for ever. Now, it's completely up to Sue to open the little box, get the key, and free her goldfish.\n\r\nThe box looks regular at first, but modern technology seems to be to the Goo-monsters' liking. On one of the sides, Sue sees a touchscreen panel, with the following five words written one on top of the other:\n\r\nAQUARIUM\r\nBELATED\r\nCAIRO\r\nMELODY \r\nHUMOUR\n\r\nJust before they leave Sue all alone, the Goo-monsters say:\n\r\n\"1,2,3,\r\nWe like chronology,\r\nPush the right 5 letters\r\nAnd silky you will free!\r\nMwahahahahaha!!!!!\"\n\r\n\"It must be some sort of pattern between the letters I have to push\", Sue thinks to herself. \"What are the right 5 letters that can free my very good friend Silky?\"",

With a small spark of hope, she attempts to rescue Silky using this combination; however, it turns out to be unsuccessful. The end-letter strategy, while innovative, did not align with the Goo-monsters' chronological hint. Deflated but not defeated, Sue vows to analyze the clue more closely in her next dream.",
            "B: Sue pressed the second letter from the first word, the third from the second word, and so on, creating the set: Q, L, I, O, U. Filled with hope, she reaches for the aquarium, but realizes that wasn't the right combination. The pattern seemed logical, but she missed the subtlety of the Goo-monsters' clue about chronology, leading to her temporary dismay. Nevertheless, she remains determined to crack the correct sequence next time.",
            "C: Confident in her hypothesis, Sue pushed the middle letter of each word: Q, A, I, O, U, convinced that this central-letter strategy would be the key to Silky's freedom. As she inputs this sequence, her heart sinks when the box remains locked. It was a clever attempt, focusing on the heart of each word, but it overlooked the explicit chronological hint provided by the Goo-monsters. Despite this setback, Sue's resolve to save Silky strengthens, ready for another challenge in her dream world.",
            "D: Sue pushed the first letter from the first word, the second from the second word, and so on, forming the 5 vowels: A, E, I, O, U. Happy with her success, she takes out the key and frees Silky, who is thankful to have such a clever friend.\n\r\nThe Goo-monsters offer a clue when they refer to chronology or, in other words, order.\r\n\"The words depend on each other...\" in the hint refers to the fact that the code would no longer make sense if one of the words were taken out or switched with another one of the five words.\n\r\nSue wakes up happy that Silky is free. She is well aware that the following night she will have to be tested again, but she feels confident. She will do anything to keep the Goo-monsters from stopping her friend from reaching Fish Heaven!"

            "A: 30 miles per hour.\n\r\nStep 1: If he wants an average speed of 20 miles per hour on a 40 mile trip, then he needs to travel for a total time of 2 hours.\n\r\nStep 2: Since he travels at a speed of 15 miles per hour during the first half of the trip, it takes him 80 minutes for the first half, so he has 40 minutes left to travel 20 miles.\n\r\nStep 3: Since he needs to travel 20 miles in 40, simply add one half of 40 (20), to make 60 (an hour), and do the same to the 20 miles he needs to travel to find out how many miles per hour he needs to travel.\n\r\nComplicated, eh?",
            "B: 25 miles per hour.\n\nStep 1: If aiming for an average speed of 20 miles per hour on a 40-mile trip, he needs to complete the journey in 2 hours.\n\nStep 2: With the initial pace of 15 miles per hour over the first half, he spends 80 minutes on this segment, leaving him with 40 minutes to complete the remaining distance.\n\nStep 3: Considering the reduced time frame, adding a partial increment to his initial speed yields a logically increased pace, which mistakenly suggests adjusting the speed to 25 miles per hour to meet the desired average.",
            "C: 40 miles per hour.\n\nStep 1: Targeting an average travel speed of 20 miles per hour for the entirety of the 40-mile journey necessitates a total duration of merely 2 hours.\n\nStep 2: The first segment's speed at 15 miles per hour, covering half the distance, consumes 80 minutes, leaving a mere 40 minutes for the rest.\n\nStep 3: Misguided by the need to drastically reduce the remaining travel time, a flawed computation suggests doubling the velocity to 40 miles per hour for the final half, following inappropriate mathematical logic.",
            "D: 35 miles per hour.\n\nStep 1: To achieve an average velocity of 20 miles per hour across a 40-mile stretch, the total travel time must not exceed 2 hours.\n\nStep 2: Traveling the initial 20 miles at 15 miles per hour utilizes 80 minutes of available time, allocating 40 minutes for the latter half.\n\nStep 3: Under the belief that a significant speed boost is needed to offset the initial slower pace, the calculation error proposes accelerating to 35 miles per hour for the second segment, using an erroneous adjustment methodology."

On Wednesday morning, a lone kidnapper telephoned the mansion and made his demands. The younger Wembly son, Eric, was to bring the money in unmarked bills in a duffel bag. He was to take a specific route from the mansion, parking in a downtown lot and carrying the bag through an alley to a drop site in a nearby park.\n\r\nThe normally cheap Jonas Wembly was frantic and willingly agreed to the terms.

He was wearing blue jeans and a dark cardigan. Sorry I can't be more specific.\"\n\r\nIn the case's one lucky break, a police officer came across Eric shortly after the attack.

The second oldest, however, has a 2 out of 5 chance of sitting next to the first person in age order since they could sit in any of the remaining four seats but only two would maintain age order adjacent to the first person. Thus, the odds for the third person are 1 out of 4, as they must pick the one seat that continues the age sequence correctly. The odds for the fourth person to sit correctly by age are then calculated as 1 out of 3, leading to the youngest having a guaranteed correct seat. The calculation would then falsely suggest 1 * 2/5 * 1/4 * 1/3 * 1, equating to 1/24 or 23:1 odds against.",
            "B: The odds are 5:1. (The probability is 1/6.)\n\nConsider the arrangement where the first person who sits down does so with no specific orientation, automatically aligning with age order. For the second oldest, there's essentially a choice of 5 seats, but with the orientation (clockwise or counterclockwise) two favorable options exist out of the four possibilities, giving a 2/5 chance. For the third person, the probability was incorrectly estimated to be 1/4 because they appear to have four seats to choose from, only one of which will be correct, ignoring the correct ongoing sequence. Similarly, the fourth person supposedly has a 1 out of 3 chance, maintaining the sequence wrongfully. This leads to a miscalculated probability sequence of 1 * 2/5 * 1/4 * 1/3 * 1 = 1/6, or 5:1 odds against.",
            "C: The odds are 11:1.  (The probability is 1/12.)\n\r\nImagine they sat down in age order, with each person randomly picking a seat.  The first person is guaranteed to pick a seat that \"works\".  The second oldest can sit to his right or left, since these five can sit either clockwise or counterclockwise.  The probability of picking a seat that works is thus 2/4, or 1/2.  The third oldest now has three chairs to choose from, one of which continues the progression in the order determined by the second person, for a probability of 1/3.  This leaves two seats for the fourth oldest, or a 1/2 chance.  The youngest would thus be guaranteed to sit in the right seat, since there is only one seat left.  This gives 1 * 1/2 * 1/3 * 1/2 * 1 = 1/12, or 11:1 odds against.",
            "D: The odds are 19:1. (The probability is 1/20.)\n\nIn this scenario, the argument might start with the assumption that any of the five can sit in any seat as the first person, setting a base that doesn't affect the odds. However, for the second to sit correctly, there is a supposed 3 out of 5 chance, mistakingly considering seats on both immediate sides plus an erroneous extra option. The third has a 2 out of 4 chance by this flawed logic, supposedly leaving two correct options to maintain age order. For the fourth, the incorrect calculation gives them a 50% chance (1 out of 2), neglecting the proper sequence's establishment entirely. The sequence falsely presented as 1 * 3/5 * 2/4 * 1/2 * 1 = 1/20, representing 19:1 odds against."

Misinterpretation of clue (2) might lead to the mistaken belief that because there are no candidates between 60 and 69, and ignoring the multiplicity with 4, one could erroneously deduce 57 as a likely candidate, disregarding the logical deduction needed to isolate the correct number.  \nThus, a misguided deduction could mistakenly identify Mad Ade's house number as 57.",

        "options": [
            "A: Abjar couldn't have made toast in 1902 the way he described because bread slicing machines weren't widely available until after Otto Frederick Rohwedder perfected his design in the 1920s. Before this innovation, bread was not consistently sliced, making such toasting competitions impractical and less common.",
            "B: Since Charles Strite invented the modern pop-up toaster in 1919, there was no way that Abjar and Geoff could have had a competition 17 years prior to its invention. Back then, the toasters were completely manual. You had to take the bread out, and flip it around to toast both sides. If Swaff would have caught this simple fact, he would have not had to go through such embarrassment.",
            "C: The story was implausible because the concept of electrical power in homes to operate such a toaster was not common until the late 1920s. Most households in 1902 would not have had the electrical infrastructure to support the use of an electric toaster, making Abjar's competition story highly unlikely.",
            "D: It was impossible for Abjar's story to be true because the record for the \"farthest bread pop\" was not established until the late 20th century. Competitive distances for toast popping as a recognized event did not exist in 1902, implying that Abjar\u2019s claim of setting such a record was fabricated."

            "B: Grass!  \nExplanation: While \"grass\" from Group B shares a natural element connection with \"peach,\" suggesting a subtle link to the question's theme, it fails the specific test set by the original answer. Unlike \"motion,\" pronouncing \"grass\" with its first letter as an individual syllable does not result in a new word, thus making it a crafty, yet incorrect choice.",
            "C: Peach!  \nExplanation: By offering \"peach\" as an option, its initial appeal lies in its contrast to the abstract nature of \"motion\" yet maintains a tangential connection through a sensory experience (taste/movement). Despite this, \"peach\" similarly does not comply with the pronunciation rule required to transition it into another word, defining its role as an ingeniously misleading option.",
            "D: Motion\n\r\nIf you pronounce the words in Group A so that the first letter of each word is an individual syllable, you get new words: ceiling, derive, effort, estate.  Only with motion from Group B can the same thing be done: emotion."

They decided to take a round of ancient lands and explore some of their traditions.\n\r\nAs was bound to happen, frequently they landed up flouting the tradition of the time, and in those days, ancient as they were, imprisonment was unheard of. The penalty for any kind of crime was death by hanging!\n\r\nTheir time capsule was programmed for them to stay in the ancient world for 10 days, so they had to be real careful to stay out of trouble.\n\r\nAs luck would have it, Nilly managed to look into one of the ancient men's homes when they were out at work, and the ladies of the family promptly informed the men when they returned.\n\r\nSure enough, the next day, Nilly found himself in the public execution area with a noose around his neck! Aghast, Willy was pleading with the King, who had also come to view the execution.\n\r\nFor this teaser's sake, we have to now assume that the King actually spoke and understood English very well!

The mystery remains unsolved to this day! \n\r\nWilly was surprised to hear the King laugh and reply in English - \"You will be given one chance, one single chance to save your friend. Do you agree?\"\n\r\nWilly readily agreed. The King fished out an ancient scroll from his robes and presented it to Willy.\"Solve this if you can\", he rumbled, \"and your friend can go free\".\n\r\nOn the scroll was written the following -\n\r\nA-7,14\r\nB-9\r\nD-16,20\r\nE-10,11,19\r\nF-21\r\nH-6\r\nI-2\r\nL-3,4\r\nN-1,12,18,24\r\nO-17,22,25\r\nP-13\r\nR-15,23\r\nS-8\r\nW-26\r\nY-5\n\r\nCan you decipher what this was?
